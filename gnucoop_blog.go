		Content: `In rural areas, access to fast and accurate medical information can be an issue. This is particularly important in time of emergencies, such as during disease outbreaks or natural disasters, when timely information can save lives.

In 2012 in Malawi, Gnucoop staff has developed for COOPI (Cooperazione Internazionale) and UNICEF, an ODK mobile and web platform in order to support health operators from remote areas, in collecting and sending information about IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) monitoring and drugs stock levels.

The system was developed in accordance to the guidelines established by the IMCI protocol, promoted by WHO. Six Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) in Salima District, in the central area of Malawi, were provided with Android smartphones equipped with the Open Data Kit (ODK) application. HSA were filling out specifically developed ODK forms, customised accordingly to the IMCI WHO algorithm, to provide basic care to children under 5 years of age affected by the most common diseases (i.e.: malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, etc...). Following instructions and questions provided by the ODK forms, HSA were guided in performing child visits at village clinics. Therefore, the IMCI-smartphone application worked as a point of care supporting tool for the HSAs.

In addition to the point of care supporting function, this mhealth system provided also information and warnings about drugs stockouts and reminders about children needing follow up.

Lesson learnt

The system was implemented for a couple of years, under UNICEF and DIPECHO funds. After its implementation we learnt some key lessons that may be useful also to implement future projects:

technology is not the solution but it is a tool/mean that can help to achieve the set targets;

specific human resources should be dedicated by the implementing organisation to manage and monitor an mhealth (or ICT4D) project;

national authorities should be involved in all the phases of the project, from the design and data collection to the scaling up;

users' feedback needs to be collected in order to improve the system over time.

This teacher has many resources today to acquire more knowledge about that culture or of some culture of countries that uses that language he is teaching. When teaching international students Mandarin, teachers should not just teach the language, grammar, but the Chinese cultural dissemination needs to be included as well, which is extremely important because the language reflects the cultural exchange. Culture is a necessary condition for language learning, which can help students better understand Chinese.

Objective of the platform

The development of this web platform want to enhance the analysis and elaboration of the data collected from UNHCR Livelihood and Energy programs partners.
It is accessible through a web browser and it imports the raw data collected through Kobo toolkit by the different partner of UNHCR Livelihood and Energy sector.
The data analysis and elaboration returns the values of all the impact Indicators. 
The user can also find the complete list of indicators in the About Section of the Platform.

The new system will simplify and accelerate information management and sharing data between partners, giving furthermore the possibility to download raw data, navigate and download specific Indicators and download reporting documents. The platform will also facilitate communication and exchange of information between partners working in the same areas or in close proximity.
Every user can visualize data and navigate the different indicators, tables and documents.

		Content: `Anche a Gnucoop festeggiamo l’anniversario della convenzione sui diritti dell’infanzia, raccontando la nostra piccola esperienza in ambito educativo. Nell’ultimo anno abbiamo avuto il piacere di collaborare con [CIAI (Centro Italiano Aiuti all’Infanzia)](http://www.ciai.it/) su due importanti progetti finalizzati a sostenere l’inserimento scolastico di bambini particolarmente vulnerabili in Africa, in particolare in Burkina Faso e in Etiopia. 

In entrambi i casi, il problema che CIAI vuole risolvere - i progetti sono ancora in corso - è quello di trovare un modo accurato, sostenibile e relativamente facile, per monitorare la frequenza scolastica. Stiamo parlando di contesti particolarmente fragili, dove per i bambini il rischio di lasciare la scuola è molto alto e le istituzioni scolastiche non sempre hanno la possibilità di intervenire tempestivamente ed efficacemente nei confronti di chi, spesso in silenzio, si allontana dalla scuola. Classi sovraffollate, impegno dei bambini in lavori stagionali, dati approssimativi e difficilmente disponibili a chi prende decisioni, questi sono solo alcune delle cause principali della mancanza di interventi. 

Per cercare di rispondere a questi problemi, Gnucoop ha sviluppato due strumenti con caratteristiche molto diverse che però puntano allo stesso obiettivo: monitorare la frequenza scolastica.  

In Burkina Faso abbiamo realizzato un’app per smartphone che permette, scattando una semplice foto alla classe, di effettuare l’appello, contando quanti bambini sono presenti. Tramite un algoritmo di face recognition, l’app è in grado di contare quanti bambini sono presenti nell’immagine dividendoli in maschi e femmine. L’algoritmo è basato su una rete neurale che è stata allenata a riconoscere bambini burkinabé tramite un training set di 2500 immagini, costruito ad-hoc dai nostri tecnici. I dati sulle presenze scolastiche vengono raccolti e, in tempo reale, trasmessi al dipartimento del ministero dell’educazione che in questo modo può avere informazioni tempestive ed affidabili sulla frequenza nelle proprie scuole, e orientare interventi specifici in modo puntuale e capillare.

[Facial-Recognition](https://www.gnucoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facial-Recognition.mp4)[Download](https://www.gnucoop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Facial-Recognition.mp4)

In Etiopia invece, dove il progetto realizzato da CIAI punta a reinserire nel percorso formativo ragazze che hanno abbandonato la scuola, abbiamo creato una piattaforma di raccolta dati che, tramite il lavoro di 40 operatori di terreno, viene alimentata con i dati sulla frequenza di ciascuna ragazza. I dati vengono raccolti tramite dispositivi mobili - telefoni o tablet - anche in assenza di connessione ad internet. Una volta che i device mobili sono stati sincronizzati, è possibile avere in tempo reale una rappresentazione precisa dell’andamento della frequenza scolastica delle 10.000 ragazze assistite in 4 regioni diverse del paese. La piattaforma si basa su DEWCO, uno strumento di raccolta dati realizzato da noi di Gnucoop che permette di progettare e realizzare una qualunque attività di raccolta dati in modo flessibile e molto personalizzabile.  

Un'app per le scuole del Burkina Faso e una piattaforma per il recupero delle ragazze in Etiopia. Questo è l’impegno che Gnucoop ha potuto mettere in atto, grazie alla collaborazione con CIAI, perché tutti bambini del mondo possano godere del diritto ad andare a scuola.`,

		Content: `A 3W web platform in the South Eastern Africa Region

In 2012, Gnucoop developed a 3W web platform for Cooperazione Internazionale, an italian NGO, to help the organisation and its partners monitoring DRR (Disaster Risk Reduction) activities in 4 countries (Comoros Islands, Madagascar, Malawi and Mozambique) in the South Eastern Africa Region (DIPECHO funded project).

But… WHAT IS A 3W PLATFORM?

Projects about disaster preparedness or response are complex as many indicators and variables need to be monitored at the same time and they may concern very different sectors of intervention: from food security and shelter management to wash and sanitation infrastructure and capacity building activities. The 3W platforms are usually built from a 3W matrix (“Who is doing What and Where“) , a well-known global tool used by humanitarian organisations to capture data from the field  and manage cluster data. The matrix is then used to generate several types of information products: from maps to graphs and tables. 3W applications provide decision makers and project managers with an easy to use system to keep control over current activities and plan future ones in a specific region.

WHO: Who is involved? 

More and more cooperation projects are requiring interactions among several organisations and governmental bodies. Also donors tend to fund projects from NGOs’ consortium to improve efficiency  of implemented actions in a specific area while avoiding overlapping and duplication of efforts. Answering to the question ‘Who is involved?’ helps to clearly identify partners working together on the same project as well as other actors that are operating in the same region.  This may also lead to new opportunities for further collaborations.

WHAT: What is being implemented?

Within a specific project, such as the DIPECHO Regional one, each partner may be specialised in a specific sector of intervention, i.e.: wash, food security, health, etc... However, these sectors are interconnected and it can be very important for a partner to know what other organisations are doing in the same area in order to identify potential collaborations or gaps. Answering to the question ‘What is being implemented?’ helps to have a clear picture of what has been achieved so far by partners as well as avoiding overlapping and duplication of efforts.  This can also turn out to be very useful in time of emergencies, as this information is critical to plan accurate response.

WHERE: Where is the activity taking place?

Project activities are implemented in several locations. If geographical coordinates of villages or towns where activities are implemented are known, it is possible to add them to basemaps such as GoogleMap or OpenstreetMap and integrating them on a web application using basic GIS or webGIS tools. Answering to the question ‘Where are activities taking place?’ helps to have a clear picture of where partners are working and if other organisations are carrying out activities in the same area or, on the contrary, if some areas are uncovered and need to be assisted.

FROM 3W  TO 4W AND 5W PLATFORMS

In the latest years, the 3W tool has also been extended to the 4th W, that represents the ‘When’, adding a temporal dimension to captured data and the 5th W, that represents the ‘Why’, indicating the needs behind a specific activity or intervention.

It is extremely important that these platforms are always kept up to date in order to provide meaningful information and guide humanitarian actors in organising a response.

The platform has been developed based on OpenGeo suite (GeoServer- OpenLayers and GeoExt) and  it is available at [http://www.sirv.tabarre.ht](http://www.sirv.tabarre.ht/)

![](/blogimages/sirvtab-1024x477.png)

Gnucoop staff spent one month in Haiti, working side by side with ngo COOPI-Cooperazione Internazionale and local authorities to define and develop the system requirements. As a result, the SIRV-TAB server allows geographic visualization of several types of information such as: public security data, presence of local organisations, water points, food storages, energy plants, transports, telecommunications, accommodations, waste management plants, roadworks and soil details.

Therefore, the SIRV-TAB database contributes to:

- identify resources that are available to manage natural or man-made disasters in Tabarre;
- manage these resources according to population needs, with a specific focus on the most vulnerable members of the society;
- identify local hazards.

The SIRV-TAB can be used by decision makers, urban planners or simply personnel operating in crisis management in Tabarre to plan prevention/preparedness measures or organise response to emergency situations.

This need was raised by the lack of information, particularly during time of emergencies, related to the availability of drugs in remote health centers in rural areas. In fact, in the event of stockouts, CSB were obliged to request medicines from the central pharmacy in Antananarivo, rather than from much closer health centers that may have that drug available in stock. Therefore, this system has the objective of reducing the time needed to send medicines to the CSB in need.

The system was based on an Ushahidi webplatform and an sms-to-email system provided by an international mobile service provider.

![](/blogimages/13363.jpg)

Medical staff from 37 CSB in Sambava were trained on the use of SMS to report information about the quantity of drugs available at the end of each month in each clinic. The SMS had a specific structure, including both letters and numbers: the letters identified the name of the drugs and the numbers identified the quantities of drug available in stock.

On the last day of the month, operators had to send the structured sms to the web platform, by using a specific phone number. Sent information was then received by the webserver and an Ushahidi report on the web-application was automatically generated, through a script developed by Gnucoop.

A medical officer at district level, supported by MdM, was monitoring the information received on the Ushahidi platform and validating reports.

Furthermore, the system included a warning component. When a CSB was reported to be out of stock for at least one of the drugs, a message or email was automatically sent to the medical officers at central level and NGO staff to report the critical situation.

The system had been implemented for several months in the second half of 2013, under DIPECHO funds. A very interesting aspect is that, although NGOs provided continuous support, the government health staff was able to perform monitoring tasks autonomously and with very limited supervision, indicating that the system was highly appreciated and user-friendly.

The webplatform is available at the following link: [http://ushahidi.gnucoop.com/](http://ushahidi.gnucoop.com/)`,

In 2012 in Malawi, Gnucoop staff has developed for COOPI (Cooperazione Internazionale) and UNICEF, an ODK mobile and web platform in order to support health operators from remote areas, in collecting and sending information about IMCI (Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) monitoring and drugs stock levels.

The system was developed in accordance to the guidelines established by the IMCI protocol, promoted by WHO. Six Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) in Salima District, in the central area of Malawi, were provided with Android smartphones equipped with the Open Data Kit (ODK) application. HSA were filling out specifically developed ODK forms, customised accordingly to the IMCI WHO algorithm, to provide basic care to children under 5 years of age affected by the most common diseases (i.e.: malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia, etc...).  Following instructions and questions provided by the ODK forms, HSA were guided in performing child visits at village clinics. Therefore, the IMCI-smartphone application worked as a point of care supporting tool for the HSAs.

In addition to the point of care supporting function, this mhealth system provided also information and warnings about drugs stockouts and reminders about children needing follow up.

![](/blogimages/mhealth.jpg)

Lesson learnt

The system was implemented for a couple of years, under UNICEF and DIPECHO funds. After its implementation we learnt some key lessons that may be useful also to implement future projects:

- technology is not the solution but it is a tool/mean that can help to achieve the set targets;
- specific human resources should be dedicated by the implementing organisation to manage and monitor an mhealth (or ICT4D) project ;
- national authorities should be involved in all the phases of the project, from the design and data collection to the scaling up;
- users’ feedback needs to be collected in order to improve the system over time.

		Content: `In 2014, Gnucoop developed the Produzioni dal basso (PDB) web application ([www.produzionidalbasso.com](http://www.produzionidalbasso.com)), a crowdfunding platform, that allows registered users to propose and fundraise money for their projects. The system is very user-friendly. Anyone can propose a project or decide to support it through different funding methodologies.

Crowdfunding is a collective effort of a group of individuals networking and pooling their resources for a specific project initiated by other people. This is usually done via or with the help of the Internet. Single projects are usually financed through small contributions from a large number of individuals. This is a more casual, yet powerful, approach based on crowd participation as well as an alternative method to specialised grant applications or more formal and traditional fundraising techniques.

Do NGOs use crowdfunding to fund their developing projects?

Most of the projects published on ‘Produzioni dal basso’ are submitted by single individuals or small/local associations. However crowdfunding can also be an interesting tool for NGOs to fundraise money for their projects. Although this way of fundraising is not yet very popular among NGOs, there are some interesting aspects related to the use of crowdfunding by NGOs:
1. gaining trust via (financial) transparency. Many crowdfunding platforms show project funding status on daily basis, as well as the number of days that are left to fundraise the remaining balance and the total amount needed per project. This helps to increase transparency and NGOs’ accountability;
2. strengthening the connection between donors and beneficiaries. Anybody, from beneficiaries, to supporters, etc…can post comments about the project or engage in a discussion related to the project, via social networks. This would increase donors’ involvement giving them the possibility to play a more active part or role in the realization of the project;
3. co-financing: often NGOs need cofinancing to reach project budget; crowdfunding could be a way to fundraise the remaining balance;
4. return on involvement: with a crowdfunding campaign it is important to think about what people want in return for their support. In general, three different categories of returns can be identified: social return (good feeling), material return (pre-sales of a product) or financial return. Although charities normally only focus on social return, it can be very interesting for them to look into other type of crowdfunding models, like reward-based crowdfunding (small or special gifts as return) of social loans (a loan with 0% interest).`,

Enter the need for smartification of humanitarian information management.
The ubiquity of technology in general and phones in particular creates a fantastic opportunity for improvements in data collection.
Field assessments can be conducted via mobile phone and the data relayed to servers for quicker analysis and faster response. Data becomes much more easily retrievable, and not dependent on manual labor. This ensures the data is as current as possible but also less prone to errors from human intervention.

“The digital agenda is becoming a ‘must do’, rather than a ‘nice to do’. We’re being asked to do more with less or the same and the only way to do this is to do things differently – including through digital” 
Tim Robinson, DFID NED

The basic attributes of digital technologies (also refered to in international development
circles as Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D)) are:
connectivity, communication, and information.
Our emphasis is on how we use the more recent, and fast-growing digital communication technologies (mobile phones and Internet) that allow people and organisations to communicate and share information digitally.
Tools and approaches include:
Mobile – SMS, apps, Interactive Voice Response (IVRs), mobile money, solar-powered phone chargers, low cost smartphones
Internet – websites, social media, knowledge platforms, databases, management information systems
Data – open data, big data, data collection, data mining, data monitoring, analytics
Activities (supported or enabled by digital tools) – crowd sourcing, geo mapping, user feedback, e-learning, information dissemination, real time monitoring, low cost diagnostics
Emerging technologies – smartcards, biometrics, 3D printing, Google glass, wearable tech, TV white space, unmanned aeriel vehicles (drones, satellites)

		Content: `India is one of the world’s largest food producers with more than 200 million people currently estimated to work in agriculture, around 100 million of them farmers and the remainder working as agricultural labourers. In India, around 62% of farmers own less than one hectare of land, significantly increasing their exposure to the effects of crop failure, pests, disease and volatile market pricing.

Vodafone and Accenture Strategy have identified six mobile services with the potential to transform Indian farmers’ lives and livelihoods.
Agricultural information services providing early warning of weather events, information on the best times to harvest and advice on crop techniques to enhance yields. These services could increase an estimated 60 million Indian farmers’ annual incomes by an average of US$89 a year in 2020.
Receipt services to provide greater transparency in daily commodity supply chains, allowing farmers to raise their incomes by improving efficiency and eliminating fraud.
Payments and loans enabling farmers to access simple and secure financial products and services using mobile money payment systems such as Vodafone’s M-Pesa, launched in India in April 2013. Access to highly cost-effective micro-finance and quick and transparent electronic payment systems could provide an annual benefit of US$690 for some farmers in 2020, representing a 39% increase in their average farming income.
Field audit enabling auditors monitoring quality, sustainability and certification requirements to move away from paper records and adopt instead electronic reporting via tablets and mobile data, greatly enhancing efficiency and potentially increasing annual average income by US$612 for some farmers.
Local supply chain enabling small-scale producers to transact with local co-operatives through simple but robust information services and mobile money systems. These could boost some farmers’ annual incomes by US$271 in 2020; a 50% increase on current farming incomes.
Smartphone-enabled services to provide deeper functionality and richer sources of information than is possible using basic SMS and voicemail services. While smartphone penetration is currently low in rural areas in emerging market economies, average device prices continue to fall year-on-year. Advanced and affordable mobile services could lead to an increase in average annual farming incomes of US$675 for more than four million farmers in 2020.

Ushahidi has an exceptionally strong user-base in Italy: there have been 165 separate deployments of Ushahidi and many deployers actively contribute to our software and documentation. Milan is also a member of the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities challenge and served as an ideal testing ground to see how Ushahidi can develop programs that include direct interaction with our users. The value of engaging communities with in-person meet-ups and workshops goes beyond training users about our tools, but also creates synergy by providing a forum for people who may be working on the same problems to meet and begin sharing knowledge.

![](/blogimages/19903220592_4a9e7d0d39_z-e1438066895793.jpg)

For Ushahidi, these gatherings allow us to discover new users, new uses of our tools, and to receive feedback from those who regularly use them. This informs the evolution of our technology and the structure of our programs to serve their needs. It also informs how we translate our tools and user manuals. We are currently working with volunteers from the Italian community to create a user guidein Italian (based on our recently updated guide) and on translation of other Ushahidi products. This way, Ushahidi builds capacity for training and support within a network that can continue to replicate and scale their efforts.

There's been a lot of hype around digital citizen feedback platforms. The lure of using mobile phones to receive reports from citizens anywhere across the globe, neatly documented on a digital map has led to a flurry of applications.

The Kenyan mapping platform Ushahidi has over 10,000 implementations. It's been used across the globe in emergency responses and to monitor elections, forced evictions, outbreaks of violence and diseases like swine flu, to name just a few. What better way to get information right from the ground in real time?

But behind the hype, report numbers and response rates are often disappointingly low and practitioners working in complex environments are trying to understand why.

Why should citizens bother reporting?
Who will address their concerns?

Then there's the question of ensuring that whoever's receiving the reports, be it government, campaigners or charities, are willing and able to respond to reports coming in - a tough task in complex environments.

Somewhere between the hype and the cynicism, there are, perhaps, ways to amplify the voices of marginalised communities and ensure that their needs are met. At Indigo Trust, we spoke with some of our grantees to identify factors that can support this.
• Use appropriate technology
• Adequate marketing
• Build in accountability mechanisms
• Building confidence and trust with citizens and service providers

The program included a hackaton to work on tech solutions and products to aid both refugees and agencies, starting on Thursday evening, after a brief presentation of the needs made by some humanitarian actors: [Red Cross](https://www.cri.it/home), [INTERSOS](http://www.intersos.org), [Save the Children](http://www.savethechildren.it/) (you can find their presentation [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4J1Usf5gtjeT2dZVGxXS3pKTEk/view?usp=sharing)).
The second day foresaw a series of panels about technologies,Corporate Care, funding, mapping, sharing economy etc... (Program is available [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/151446408542270/)).

All the participants has been divided into 5 groups.
Our team consisted of three people.
We decided to work on the Intersos Challenge n.2: a system to manage the security of aid workers, that can track their location wherever they are.
Briefly, the idea is the following:
The mobile app automatically reports the location of the Aid worker, sending GPS coordinates to the server.
The operator can select the security level of the area.
The platform sends an alert notification when it detects that an operator is located in an area previously reported as dangerous.
The frequency of the notifications varies depending on the security level of the area and on the time of permanence in the same place.
Through the Crowdmapping platform we will have a security level map of the area of intervention.
Below the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeq8bZHoWIw) we prepared for the final panel of the conference and the presentation to the donor.

The winning team proposed a project to meet the Red Cross Challenge 2: Efficient use of resources - How to distribute food supplies to avoid waste.
Thanks to Paypal they will develop the platform over the next few months.

We have been awarded a "Special Mention" and we’ll develop the App!

		Content: `“The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”
This quote, attributed to Bill Gates, refers to how technology works to complement good systems, not replace them. During break-out sessions at the recent [ICTforAg Conference](http://ictforag.org/), we discussed why this is also true of the relationship between information and communication technologies (ICT) and monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E). ICTs – most notably smart phones and tablets – are often used as a more efficient means to obtain and analyze project data. Although M&amp;E is often seen as a driver for the use of ICTs, there are still many challenges for organizations to realize the full potential of ICT in M&amp;E.
It’s Not Just About Technology
Panelists Ben Jacques-Leslie from the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL), Katherine Scaife Diaz from TechnoServe, and Michael Reiter from FINTRAC presented on their organizations’ history of integrating ICT into M&amp;E. Each presenter touched on the imperative of working better and more efficiently. This spurred an interest in more efficiency in data collection, which has been addressed through the use of ICTs.
Technologies such as satellite imagery have been piloted to more accurately and efficiently measure yield, while current point of sale technology could improve the accuracy of input costs estimates and commodity sales prices.
But the question that remained in everyone’s minds was: Is efficiency and confidence in data collection achieved through technology, or is it more a function of using sound M&amp;E systems? Mr. Jacques-Leslie argued that there is currently little evidence that technology actually improves data quality and that this is something that JPAL intends to study.
Going back to that Gates quote, which Katherine Scaife Diaz shared at the beginning of the session, no amount of technology can work around inefficient M&amp;E systems. Technology applied to an inefficient system will only magnify the problem.
Data Collection Methods &amp; The Human Element
Although the disdain for paper-based data collection was palpable in the room, I saw many heads nodding when a participant noted that paper might still be the best data collection method in places where there simply isn’t the infrastructure and experience to support the use of ICTs. If technology use is appropriate – and data collection becomes more efficient as a result – can decision-makers really make full use of all the data? And in this scenario, what is truly efficient? Is it spending less time collecting the same amount of data or collecting even more data with the newfound time?
If it is the latter, does that mean it’s time for the development sector to embrace advanced algorithms that use development data to create simple triggers to help decision makers, thus removing much of the human analysis element? Does the sector have sufficient trust in the current quality of data to move in that direction?
Data quality is of utmost importance to M&amp;E, but ensuring data quality continues to be a struggle within the sector. The group explored many technology-based ideas to increase data quality and participant tracking, including biometric data collection (iris scanning, finger print scanning) and technology enabled systems to identify outlier data.
Unfortunately, many of these solutions have yet to be developed, are cost-prohibitive, or are fraught with data privacy concerns. As a result, the human element surfaced again. Many of us agreed that data is only as good as the skills of the person collecting it. Some enumerators have higher capacity than others, yet system-wide data quality checks rarely account for this. Could data quality be improved through the use of reputation-based data verification systems that focus data quality checks on lower capacity enumerators while giving higher capacity enumerators more leeway?
Unquestionably, ICT has the potential to transform the efficiency and usefulness of data collection, as well as boosting organizational confidence in data collected through M&amp;E systems. But it also has the potential to create inefficiencies if applied in inefficient operations where human capacity and technological infrastructure is low.

When this tragedy reached our borders and, above all arrived on our media, many initiatives were born to involve the tech community on these issues.
The first one was [Mike Butcher](https://twitter.com/mikebutcher)’s [Techfugees](http://techfugees.com/) a conference and a hackathon where the London tech community showed their support for refugees. In a few days a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Techfugees/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Techfugees) accounts exploded, showing the huge interest of the tech community to be involved in this issue.
Many other conferences, events, hackathons have been organized all over Europe, one in Italy hosted by [H-Farm](http://www.h-farmventures.com/en/) where we’ve been present (you can read about it [here](https://www.gnucoop.com/gnucoop-at-techfugees-italy/)).
During these months, following all these groups and initiatives we have collected some of the ideas and the applications developed in support of refugees.

So this blog wants to be a focal point for all of the organizations which work for refugees and need or are looking for help from technology experts.
This is the place where we collect everything that can be found online on “Technology for Refugees”.
The applications will be divided into groups, using different Tags, examples: 
#mobility -  online and offline maps, info on travel; 
#security - safe or unsafe zone;  
#services for refugees - reception centers, centers for asylum, news, rights and law, important phone numbers, dictionary etc..;
#for aid orgs - geospatial and technical knowledge to help support the humanitarian network, where, when and how to help directly in the field; 
#education - mobile learning services.

Another purpose of this blog is to deal with those organizations who are working on these issues in order to support them in the use of technology.
You can find [here](http://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/rohan-silva-tech-city-s-response-to-the-refugee-crisis-shows-real-innovation-a3082841.html) a lovely piece by @rohan__silva on #techfugees where he underlines two important things:
first it’s a shame that the organisations playing the central role in responding to the refugee crisis — government aid agencies and big charities — are so disconnected from the type of grassroots innovation on display at the Techfugees event and secondly it was wonderful to see London’s technology cluster coming together for such an important cause.

These tools can help the organizations to be in contact with donors, volunteers, to be more efficient, and to give more visibility to their interventions.
Let’s give you an idea as to which tools Google can offer you:
- you can reduce the IT costs and create a better collaboration between the HQ and Staff in the fields;
- you can store many documents: 30 GB of storage space on Gmail and Google Drive;
- you are connected wherever you are and you gain access to your data everywhere;
- you have assistance from Google 24/7; you don’t need hardware and updating;
- Google Apps for nonprofits is free for all the members of TechSoup Global.

One of the main problems faced by NGOs with staff working abroad in some remote areas with slow connections is the possibility to be in contact with the HQ, to send and receive documents, to store a lot of information about the projects that they are developing.
Thanks to Drive, you can save all your work in one secure online place. You can always gain access to them from pc, tablet or smartphone.
You can share all of your files immediately with your team without using heavy attachments or using different file versions (one of the worst nightmares!).
With Drive Document you can create and modify your text directly in your browser without any specific software. Many people can work simultaneously on the same doc and all the modifications are automatically saved.
Sometimes the work environment for aid workers is not so easy, they have to face many difficulties, the possibility to have a stronger connection with HQ can really be helpful.
Through Google Apps you have many tools to make it possible.
Google for nonprofits now is available for the Italian NGOs, follow the [link](https://www.google.it/intl/it/nonprofits/join/)

We hold trainings on the use of Google Apps and we support the change management for the transition to the Google system.

The circumstances in which refugees leave their country of origin frequently involve the separation of families. Such separation invariably leads to hardship and sometimes to tragic consequences.

What people are demanding, more and more, is not classic food, shelter, water, healthcare, but they demand wifi, said Melita Šunjić, a spokesperson for the [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees](http://www.unhcr.org).
As borders and routes constantly change, it becomes both more important and more difficult for refugees and aid organizations alike to share information.
Access to technology, information and communication, Šunjić said, is beginning to be regarded as a basic of humanitarian aid.
Simpler access to information and existing services can reduce barriers to integration. Very often, this approach can also be solved with practical apps that can be used at a smartphone, here you can fin some examples..

Thank you to all of our supporters!
But the core idea of the campaign to involve software developers, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) experts, NGOs professionals, helping us to develop an application that will be available for every person involved has not dead. 
If you like to contribute with your expertise to the realization of this tool [contact us](http://info@gnucoop.com)!

OUR PROJECT: PARSIFAL , ICT4D for M&amp;E
Monitoring and evaluation is a key component of most cooperation and development projects. While NGOs have been mostly using pen and paper forms to collect project data and spending a lot of time and resources in re-organising collected information, the increasing access to ICT tools is opening new frontiers to project data collection and management. Information can be digitized as early as during the data collection phase and up to the final phase of extraction of statistical data for final reporting.
There is no need to look for complex solutions, often the simplest ones are also the best ones. However, technology itself is not sufficient to meet project objectives. Having a team that can design the data collection strategy, implement it accordingly, and evaluate the final data is as important as the technology itself.
So, are you tired of collecting data by paper forms for your M&amp;E system?
Gnucoop has developed, with support of Silvia Favaron, an M&amp;E web platform based on the logical framework approach, allowing project staff to systematically plan and monitor indicators throughout the duration of the project. We will also be looking at integrating into the current system a mobile-phone data collection tool based on [ODK](https://opendatakit.org/) technology.
We’d like to turn our project into a free software project.
Free software means users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.
We’ll release the source code (issued under AGPLv3 license) so everyone could benefit from it.
Part of the amount collected will be used to cover some start-up expenses and for server maintenance.

GNUCOOP - WHO WE ARE
Gnucoop is a team of Engineers, experts in Information Technology and professionals in the field of Development and Cooperation. [Here we are](https://www.gnucoop.com/about/)!
We started in 2006 as a small group of free-lance IT professionals with the idea that free software and technologies have great economical and technical advantages and they can provide very useful tools to achieve Companies/Institutions/NGOs/Research Institutes/Aid Agencies’ objectives.
We actively participate in the international debate on the use of technology as aid supporting tool, linking up with the international network of aid worker and the international IT community.
Gnucoop is actively involved in both the national (Italian, through the Italian [ONG2.0 network](http://www.ong2zero.org/en/)) and international debate (as member of the [Digital Humanitarian Network](http://digitalhumanitarians.com/)) about the use of sustainable technological solutions in development and cooperation projects.

M&amp;E FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
M&amp;E consists of two distinct but complementary parts:
• Monitoring1 is the routine collection and analysis of information to track progress against set plans. It helps to identify trends and patterns, adapt strategies, and inform decisions for project/program management.
• Evaluation2 is an assessment of an ongoing or completed project, program, or policy, with respect to its design, implementation, and results. The purpose is to determine the relevance and fulfilment of objectives, and/or developmental efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of the activity.
M&amp;E enables improved project oversight, informed decision-making, continuous learning, and evidence-based communication of results.

ICT4D
ICT4D stands for Information and Communication Technology for Development.
ICT4D focuses on the use of communication and technological tools to achieve important goals in the promotion of health, education and information everywhere. Important results have been achieved in the healthcare sector, in micro economics activities, in education, in disaster prevention and response.
ICT has the potential to transform the efficiency and usefulness of data collection, as well as boosting organizational confidence in data collected through M&amp;E systems.

We start with some basic information… what is mHealth? First of all, we need to understand what an health system is. An Health system is a combination of structures, processes and resources required to deliver healthcare to the population. Therefore, this system needs financing mechanisms, well trained and paid workforce, reliable information and well ­maintained facilities to guarantee a good service to patients.

Where does the mHealth come in then?

Well, in some contexts those requirements are not totally fulfilled. Particularly when reliable information is missing, it is very difficult to monitor the spread of diseases, understand if patients’ conditions are properly diagnosed or if proper treatments are given, just to mention a few… here is where mHealth can play a very important role.

According to [WHO](http://www.who.int/en/), Mobile Health (m­Health) is the “Provision of health services and information via mobile and wireless technologies. mHealth includes mobile phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), tablets, mobile applications and wireless medical devices“.

mHealth has the potential to address and overcome challenges such as:

- Disparities in access to health services, helping remote communities to also connect and avail of health services;
- Inadequacies of the health infrastructure, supporting in monitoring the quality of health posts and health centers;
- Shortage of human resources for health, by empowering health promoters and spreading educational messages.

— Open Society Foundation's Maria Teresa Rojas and Alyssa Ross

The scale of the current Syrian refugee crisis has generated significant involvement from private actors, including corporations and individuals. With governments overwhelmed and unable to adequately address the situation, the private sector has a critical role to play in providing for immediate humanitarian needs, as well as supporting refugee resettlement and integration. Private sector involvement in economic development and job creation is also a key component of the long-term solution, which goes beyond this current crisis.
While Syrians trying to reach Europe have dominated headlines, there are many other large refugee populations from a wide variety of countries, including Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Iraq, Myanmar, Somalia and Sudan. While some of these situations have endured for decades, others are relatively new, or have worsened in recent years. These refugees have settled throughout the world, from Kenya to India, Russia, Pakistan and Chad.
By the end of 2015, 1 in 122 people in the world had been forced to flee his or her home. More than 20 million people are currently refugees, the highest number in over two decades. Millions of others have been forced to move within their own countries: counting both refugees and internally displaced persons, the United Nations estimates that as many as 60 million are currently displaced, a number that has risen rapidly from the 45.2 million reported in 2012. The sheer volume has made it difficult for the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, and host governments to cope. Asylum applications were up 78 percent from 2014 to 2015, and the pressure on host countries has grown significantly.
Businesses and other private entities have responded in a number of ways. Many companies have been working to integrate migrants quickly into host country job markets, an effort that benefits both refugees and businesses.
At U.S.-based Chobani, the world’s largest yogurt factory, refugees account for around 30 percent of a total workforce of 2,000 people. Chobani’s CEO, Hamdi Ulukaya, who also created the Tent Foundation to funnel money and technology into programs that help refugees, has called on corporate leaders to step up and provide job training, employment opportunities, and direct assistance.
In Germany, where an aging population has resulted in more than half a million unfilled jobs, corporations have called for an overhaul of laws to allow asylum-seekers to enter the labor force more quickly. Last September, Germany’s four main employers’ associations, which represent hundreds of thousands of companies, requested that the country give approved asylum-seekers faster access to the labor market, as well as to language and skills training. German companies have also developed business to business networks to facilitate the hiring and training of refugees.
Some private entities have offered internships, scholarships, and training courses for refugees, while others have been providing educational opportunities. In Europe, a number of corporations have been hiring refugees as paid interns. These include Deutsche Telekom, Evonik, Bosch Group, Uniqlo and Siemens. Other companies have focused on improving access to education for young refugees.
For example, the Vodafone Foundation has created a digital “school in a box” to bring tablet-based teaching to young refugees living in the Dadaab region of Kenya. The initiative, started in partnership with UNHCR, brings an instant classroom, which can be assembled in 20 minutes, to areas where electricity and internet connectivity are unreliable or nonexistent.
In an effort to better integrate refugees into German society, the football club Bayern Munich has created a “training camp,” which offers food, German language classes, and football equipment. The club also raised 1 million euros ($1.11 million) at a friendly match to support integration projects in Germany.
Greater private sector involvement would add much-needed resources to those invested by the public sector, enhance the efficiency of projects, and improve prospects for success. A coordinated response would contribute in ways that benefit businesses, refugees, and host societies alike.
This is a critical moment for expanding private sector involvement, and for building upon the work that is already being done.

We can start talking about what is happening in Uganda, not because it’s representative of all host countries but ‘cause it's exceptional. Unlike most host countries around the world, what Uganda has done is give refugees economic opportunity. It gives them the right to work. It gives them freedom of movement. And the results of that are extraordinary both for refugees and the host community. In the capital city, Kampala, 21 percent of refugees own a business that employs other people, and 40 percent of those employees are nationals of the host country. In other words, refugees are making jobs for citizens of the host country. Even in the camps, it’s easy to find extraordinary examples of vibrant, flourishing and entrepreneurial businesses.

Beyond that we should consider that going digital has the potential to fundamentally transform the relationship between citizen and government. Research has shown that disadvantaged groups, including immigrants and minorities, are high users of smartphones and social media, and could theoretically be reached through these tools. Newly arrived immigrants are some of the most vulnerable in society and are often in need of support settling in and connecting to information about local services and jobs. However, these groups are often thought to be digitally, as well as socially excluded, and the move by governments to online platforms could exacerbate existing barriers to accessing public services. Furthermore, these groups may lack the necessary digital skills and host-country language ability to take full advantage of digital government services.

Here we’ll show how in the recent Refugee Crisi it’s crossing Europe, the tech community responds to this emergency ad develope some ideas to create a link between refugees and job market.

[Incubators for Immigrants](http://incubatorsforimmigrants.com/) has been founded by a group of like-minded entrepreneurs, who agreed that a positive action had to take place instead of the endless conversations. By using another constructive way to look at ‘the problem’, they discovered that enterprising refugees could get a (temporarily) residence permit faster than usual if they would be a serious entrepreneur in the Netherlands. Incubators for Immigrants removes the bureaucracy that is involved with the foreign start-ups and with that they give refugees the same opportunities as Dutch entrepreneurs. A solution based on the fact that every human being has the same rights to free establishments and equal opportunities, including refugees who have arrived in the Netherlands.

“It soon became clear that we wanted to build a website that would support refugees in Germany. Seeing the amount of problems existing about the current refugee situation, we were certain that this could be our chance to create something valuable for refugees in Germany and the Germany society itself.
We spent the first month on doing some intensive qualitative and quantitative research with the goal of understanding all the problems about the refugee situation. We talked to refugees, very motivated initiatives, organizations and representatives of the state administration. And clearly there was a wide range of issues to tackle. From support in bureaucratic questions to finding a place to live or learning the German language; all of them were very important. But there was one issue people kept mentioning over and over again that really stuck with us: finding a job! “ David Jacob

[Kiron](https://kiron.ngo/):World-Class Education For Refugees

Our vision is to provide millions of refugees worldwide with the opportunity to graduate with an accredited university degree, free of charge. No more time, potential, or lives wasted.
![](/blogimages/Kiron-150x150.jpg)

Kiron uses an innovative combination of online and offline learning to provide accessible, sustainable, and cost-effective education. To date, we have over 1,000 students, 18 partner universities, and 4 degree programmes. That's over 1,000 lives changed already.

Kiron offers much more than just online learning. Our vision is to reinvent the traditional concept of a university: with a diverse range of partners, we are striving to create an education model that is more accessible, more human-centred, and more supportive of personal growth.

The [DigiSchool](http://www.unicefstories.org/2015/09/30/expanding-learning-opportunities-for-refugee-children-ugandas-digischool-pilot/), also known as the MobiStation, is a portable, solar-powered multimedia kit fully equipped with a speaker, projector, and a document reading camera. DigiSchool, an abridged form of “digital school in a box,” refers to devices with pre-uploaded education content. At a glance, the DigiSchool looks like an ordinary plastic suitcase with wheels and a pullout handle. But inside this black pelican case, you can find video clips, cartoons, music videos, math lessons, an offline Wikipedia, and much more.
![](/blogimages/digischool-150x150.jpg)

The current DigiSchool is a fourth generation prototype. Progress has been made since early 2013 when the Global Innovation Lab in Uganda produced the DigiSchool hardware and carried out the first user testing. On the software side, the DigiSchools’ digital content library continues to be enhanced with more educational content.`,

Over the last 25 years, the internet and mobile communications have transformed life in the industrialized and developing worlds alike. Now that so much information is readily available, we worry about overload more than scarcity. Mobile communications and social media provide abundant ways to stay in touch with friends, family and colleagues. Cloud computing, remote working and networked global teams are re-shaping the ways we interact and connect.
Not so for the world’s refugees. Today, more than 65 million people – the largest number since the Second World War – are living as refugees or are internally displaced, uprooted from their homes in search of safety, and often struggling to access the basic means of survival.
But displaced people are also living without the connectivity they need to obtain vital information, communicate with loved ones, access basic services and link to the local, national and global communities around them.
The places where they live frequently lack digital networks and infrastructure, or the connectivity available there is too expensive. The digital revolution transforming the world is leaving refugees behind.
The Need for Connectivity
UNHCR carried out a global assessment of refugees’ access to, and use of, the internet and mobile phones where available, to help inform the development of a new UNHCR Global Strategy for Connectivity for Refugees.

In the recent years, the ICTs (information and communication technologies) for development have promised the international cooperation to become more “fluid” and “open” (open-source technologies and creative commons licenses enabled individual persons, groups and organizations to have free access in various materials and products, inaccessible before).Further, the emergence of new techs such as drones, low-cost sensors, wearables and so on – the ICTs are opening up new horizons for development interventions. For instance, UNICEF and the Malawi’s government have started to test unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to reduce waiting times for HIV testing of infants. Or [RapidPro](https://community.rapidpro.io/) - an online communication platform for those who want to create an app about social issues in few steps. Examples are unlimited: from the environmental movement [Science for Change Kosovo](http://www.citizenscienceks.org/), that monitors and reports the atmosphere pollution by means of a crowdsourcing platform, to [Kilimo Salama](https://kilimosalama.wordpress.com/) (“Safe Agriculture”), a project for smallholders who can ensure their products through SMS while the insurance company checks the forecasts with weather satellites.
To respond to these new trends and progresses in the field of ICT for Development, as well as to offer new opportunity for young professionals, particularly for those from Global South, the ONG2.0 is launching the second edition of the long-term online course [“ICT: Innovations for Development”](http://www.ong2zero.org/en/ict-innovation-for-development/). The programme, absolutely unique in Italy, will allow the discussion between the lectures and participants from all the worlds thanks to the interactive and live webinars.

L’App InfoStranieri nasce nel 2014 da un’idea di Bashkim Sejdiu, trentunenne kosovaro arrivato in Italia ventun’anni fa e che da oltre dieci anni offre servizi di assistenza burocratica agli altri stranieri che vivono in Italia.

Lo scopo dell’App è quello di rispondere alle esigenze:

-  di tutti gli stranieri regolari costretti a vivere l’incubo di dover adempiere a tutta una serie di requisiti burocratici particolarmente complessi, dispendiosi in termini di tempo e per di più in un Paese del quale stanno ancora imparando la lingua;
-  dello Stato Italiano in quanto il Paese necessita di personale straniero regolare e pertanto trarrebbe molto giovamento dalla semplificazione degli adempimenti di cui sopra, con particolare riferimento alle procedure di regolarizzazione.

		Content: `Since a couple of months Gnucoop is engaged in a big project is support of UNHCR. Twine is a web-based platform currently used by UNHCR in refugee operations for data collection and reporting. We first approached this system in order to analyse its weaknesses and to come up with suggestions for the development of a new high performing and user-friendly application. 
The so-called “NewTwine” - it is our purpose to give it as well a brand-new name - is being designed from scratch, including a total review of the current system architecture and the development of a mobile application for a unique data collection tool that represents the biggest news of the project. 
This application allows to collect data and compile entry forms in a user-friendly way, visualize data, analyse and generate reports at different levels: from refugee camps worldwide to country offices up to regional and HQ level. The type of information concerns healthcare, water and sanitation, nutrition and food security sectors, where the Health Information System (HIS) functionalities entail the biggest component.
![](/blogimages/20170221_103224-300x225.jpg)
Twine is something that user can easily learn to utilize and this is huge beneficial for UNHCR at all levels because it allows the standardization and the speedup of several operations: it has just one interface for data entry; it offers the possibility of working offline and synchronizing when connection is available; it allows selected users to create and modify forms for data collection. 
The project´s implementation started in April 2016 and is going to be completed until June 2017. We are currently testing the collecting section. During the analysis phase we have been piloting a new data collection modality using Twine in the WASH sector. Scope of it was the identification of strengths and challenges before extending the new system to other intervention sectors.
A five-week-feature testing between August and September 2016 took place in four Countries, such as Kenya, Jordan, Rwanda and Tanzania. First the Out-Patient Data (OPD) collection forms were tested on 80 tablets, but the application will be responsive and therefore data could be also entered by PC, Laptop, and smartphones.
  Different persons, with individual expectations and experiences brought many useful and necessary feedback to modify and give us a better direction for the future development of the application. 
During the testing 49 versions of the application have been released and more than 150 issues fixed. Based on the feedbacks, we were able to pinpoint some weaker points in development including the   enhancement of the offline-sync function and also thinking about harmonizing across the different Twine platforms (web and mobile).  The need to focus more on the aesthetic/user interface aspects of the app has been also pointed out.
The data elaboration and reporting section is being developed  now. This tool will allow the user to create new reports and customize her/his own dashboard.
Up to now a very collaborative working atmosphere between Gnucoop staff and UNHCR is being contributing to the first positive results. We are very satisfied with that and share the opinion of Eugene Paik - Public Health Data Analyst at UNHCR - when saying that “the development is heading in the right direction”.`,

Over the past 15 years the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) revolution has driven global development in an unprecedented way. Technological progress, infrastructure deployment and falling prices have brought unexpected growth in ICT access and connectivity to billions of people around the world. The last decade has seen a proliferation of technological initiatives aimed to tackle development issues.
Through the use of ICTs, humanitarian operators can achieve a wider reach, even in most fragile contexts. The use of information technology to support data collection, analysis and elaboration has brought significant changes in the way information is managed and shared.
In this webinar, Paola Fava, Co-Founder of Gnucoop Società Cooperativa, will provide you with a general understanding of the role and impact of ICTs in the development process.
Examples on how the use of technologies has eased the work of the operators and improved lives around the world may include mobile technologies to improve timely data collection regarding basic supplies (i.e.: medicine, food, etc..) and access to primary services (i.e.:healthcare, food security, disaster preparedness, etc.) for populations facing scarcity of these goods/services as well as digital maps (GIS and WebGIS platforms) to prevent and to respond to humanitarian crisis.
The webinar will be held in English and streamed live from the HFT Stuttgart to the community group [The AGEP-Network](http://agep-info.de/)
in the Alumniportal Deutschland [http://alumniportal-deutsch-land.de/group-agep-alumni](http://alumniportal-deutsch-land.de/group-agep-alumni).

Attending the webinar is easy! Just register or login to the Alumniportal Deutschland and join the group The AGEP–Network. Becoming a member is free of charge.

You will not be able to participate in the live session? Now worries! You can attend the recorded webinar soon afterwards.

We are looking forward to seeing you online soon!

Testing at the IRC Main Hospital (OPD, IPD, RH, EPI Sectors) 

From our point of view, getting the chance to be on the field personally was of great utility. In addition to that, the presence of two persons with different competencies and capabilities - namely one developer and one project manager - was essential to understand and face the issues rised.

The workers have been explained and shown by the developer how to use the application in the very real field conditions and how to deal with some problems. We had to acknowledge that those mechanisms and passages often considered "trivial" by technicians are not regarded as such also by the users, therefore we took this as a lesson learned for the next field testing.
The deep knowledge of forms has been very helpful for feedback gathering and the related reviewing processes.
Furthermore, we could count for some urgent issues on our staff in Italy, who was reacting almost in real time to any request. 
Two categories of users participated in the test:

- Nurses / Midwives for forms related to Reproductive Health;
- Refugees employed in the clinics, for all the other forms.

Generally, the feedback we received was content-related, while almost nothing about the new collection system, that is the transition from the use of paper to electronic devices, was mentioned.
Only in the Expanding Program in Immunization (EPI) sector of the Main Hospital, the clinicians have expressed strong doubts, and declared to prefer the current paper forms.

It was the first testing so we focussed on the first feedback from the users, how they reacted to the use of the new system.  As already explained, they did not make any comments on the application but simply suggested some changes on the content of the form. 
In terms of timing, probably, after few days, they will get used to the system and get faster.
We suggest to spend more time to explain better to the users how it will change the entire process of data collecting and reviewing, thanks to the new system and make them aware about its potentials.`,

When:  Wednesday, 12 April 2017, 9 a.m. (CET)
Where: Piazza della Scienza, 4, Università degli Studi di MIlano - Bicocca
              Edificio U4, aula 2034

Gnucoop Soc. Coop. and [Stand by Task Force](http://www.standbytaskforce.org/) (SBTF) are organizing an event about the use of digital tools to support information management during natural disasters and humanitarian crisis.

When a disaster or humanitarian emergency strikes, many organisations (public agencies, humanitarian responders, governmental and non governmental organisations) activate and try to provide their support. In these contexts, it’s very important to have access to and rely on trustworthy information. If used sensibly, social networks and digital tools have the potential to provide important pieces of information that were not accessible only up to few years ago. 

Therefore, the event has two main objectives:

- to sensitize civil society organizations, civil protection organisations, public institutions, university students and volunteers on the sensible use of digital tools such as social networks, digital images, web news, etc…, to help responding to humanitarian crisis,
- to involve new ‘digital’ volunteers who could provide additional support in responding to emergencies or humanitarian crisis and become active members of the SBTF.

The program will be the following:

- Technology and Information Sharing: ICT4D project milestones
- Gnucoop tools and case studies: data collection &amp; GIS and Disaster Risk Reduction
- Information for Disaster Response: SBTF Case, Studies, Example of Deployments

We are very glad to have as our guests Mercedes Aguerre, [COOPI ](http://www.coopi.org)drr advisor, for a an introduction on Disaster Risk Reduction and  Angela Oduor Lungati, Director of Community Engagement, [Ushahidi ](http://www.ushahidi.com)to present this very successful platform.

		Content: `Over the past few months Gnucoop developed for the italian NGO [COOPI-Cooperazione Internazionale](http://www.coopi.org/en/) a GIS platform, which enable to visualize the main threats and vulnerabilities, as well as resources available in the surrounding areas to foster crisis management by turning this information into actions. 

COOPI helps communities prone to environmental disasters or other hazards deal with them. Development of geographical information systems, risk analysis and dissemination of risk management tools are among the main activities of its program within the sector.
The marginalized informal communities of Rimac District in Lima in Peru, mostly affected by earthquakes and landslides, belong to the targeted groups of COOPI. In addition to natural hazards, inadequate basic services and infrastructures, coupled with scarce  awareness about disaster risk reduction are main issues to be tackled.
The innovative aspect of the Program run by COOPI in Lima is the participatory methodology for data collection, which aims at assessing the needs in a more comprehensive way by involving several stakeholders, from Local Authorities to Institutions and organizations at different levels.

Gnucoop has been involved by COOPI in the pursuing of one of the objectives of the project, namely the creation of a geo-referenced information system about resources and vulnerabilities at both neighborhood and district level. Such a tool will contribute to provide information and knowledge of the territory for decision making, strengthen participatory planning and minimizing disaster risks  and vulnerabilities.
Based on a previous webGIS platform developed for Port-au-Prince in Haiti, the new software called Yago uses the Geoserver service for geospatial data sharing. The Geoserver implements Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS) standards and is able to use the most common geo-referenced data sources (Shapefile, geographic database as PostGIS or SpatiaLite, GeoTIFF, etc.).

Yago is a modern and light software that can also run on smartphones and tablets, developed using the Google framework Angular 2 and libraries for the development of mobile-friendly Leaflet interactive maps. It allows users and visitors to create their own maps and "surf" the resources localized in the project.
DRR
'[Disaster risk reduction (DRR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_risk_reduction) is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing the risks of disaster. It aims to reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them. Here it has been strongly influenced by the mass of research on vulnerability that has appeared in print since the mid-1970s. It is the responsibility of development and relief agencies alike. It should be an integral part of the way such organizations do their work, not an add-on or one-off action. DRR is very wide-ranging: Its scope is much broader and deeper than conventional emergency management. There is potential for DRR initiatives in just about every sector of development and humanitarian work.
The most commonly cited definition of DRR is one used by UN agencies such as UNISDR, also known as the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, and UNDP: "The conceptual framework of elements considered with the possibilities to minimize vulnerabilities and disaster risks throughout a society, to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) the adverse impacts of hazards, within the broad context of sustainable development."
[https://www.unisdr.org/archive/26424 ](https://www.unisdr.org/archive/26424)

![](/blogimages/perù-3-1024x576.jpeg)
Technology such as GIS offers the possibility of visual analysis and allows us to see political boundaries, population trends, and socioeconomic differences. It also offers us the ability to acquire and verify facts."
She also pointed out that by "using GIS technology we can analyze and see where natural disasters have previously occurred and how they have impacted the landscape. We can also try to predict where a natural disaster is most likely to occur." By understanding where disasters happen, the international community can develop new and more efficient methods to reduce future disaster risks.
"Technologies, like GIS, are important tools for understanding and supporting disaster resilient communities. Whether you're a city planner, development practitioner humanitarian responder, or crisis-mapper, information for decision-making is now at our fingertips to reduce risks and build disaster resilience."
"Society now has the capability to generate massive amounts of information. We need to be able to synthesize and analyze this information and turn it into targeted policies and actions."

Technical issues
In 2013 in Haiti, Gnucoop supported COOPI on the development of a webGIS platform, namely SIRV-TAB, to help the municipality of Tabarre (in Port-au-Prince) and the Le Centre National de l'Information Géo-Spatiale (CNIGS) in locating resources, identifying critical issues, designing urban plans and understanding local vulnerabilities in order to increase population preparedness towards natural disasters and help managing crisis. The platform has been developed based on OpenGeo suite (GeoServer- OpenLayers and GeoExt) and it is available at [http://www.sirv.tabarre.ht](http://www.sirv.tabarre.ht).

In the new phase of this partnership we’ll use only a single part of OpenGeo suite, in its latest version: the Geoserver. The Geoserver is the service used for geospatial data sharing, which implements WMS and WFS standards and it is able to use the most common geo-referenced data sources (Shapefile, geographic database as PostGIS or SpatiaLite, GeoTIFF, etc.).
In the new system the Sirvtab will be replaced by a more modern and lighter software that can also run on smartphones and tablets, developed using the Google framework Angular 2 Google and libraries for the development of mobile-friendly Leaflet interactive maps.

The software will be mainly divided into two sections:

Backend A simple and complete control panel that will allow administrators to:
manage users and permissions,

- upload geographic data in various formats (shapefiles geojson and GeoTIFF)
- manage metadata associated with geographic data,
- manage the library of documents and images,
- publish notices, news and updates visible to users of the platform.

Frontend The heart of the software that will allows users and visitors to create their own maps and "surf" the resources localized in the project. The main functions of the frontend will be:

- Create map
- Insert maps from OpenStreetMap and Google Map /BING
- Measure distances / Areas
- Create elevation profile
- Create cartograms and other geo-statistical maps
- Creating a personal profile
- Save and archive on server your own maps that can be reused later (this a function only  for registered users)
- Export maps in different formats (JPEG, PNG, PDF)

View your maps on the main navigation applications (Google Maps, iOS maps, Google Earth) (available from smartphones and tablets).

The source code will be released under a free (as in speech not free as in beer) software license and will be available probably through a github repository, to trace changes and developments over time!

Our software is available here [https://guatemala.gnucoop.io/](https://guatemala.gnucoop.io/).

All the participants, especially the Municipality staff, were really enthusiastic of the platform and they actively participated to the training.

COOPI will organize in the next weeks a presentation event to disseminate YAGO and the importance of including the use of spatial data in the daily works of the Municipality. The event will be directed to the large public to disseminate YAGO and the inclusion of the SIG in the decision making process.

We spent the first 3 days working side by side with COOPI staff.
From our point of view, getting the chance to be on the field was of great utility. Working directly with end users was key to develop some new features.
The local staff contributions were very important mainly because this project is part of a framework agreement signed by Gnucoop and COOPI, for the use of YAGO platform in four different projects:

*Renforcement des capacités de préparation, mitigation et réponse aux catastrophes de communautés urbaines les plus vulnérables en Haïti;*
*RIMAC DRR – Reinforcing Innovative Mechanisms for Arising Capacities in Disaster Risk Reduction in Rímac, Perú;*
*Améliorer la résilience face à la sécheresse des acteurs locaux et des familles rurales les plus vulnérables dans la partie orientale du Département du Sud-Est, Haïti;*
*Fortalecimiento de las capacidades del sistema CONRED y de la sociedad civil en comunidades de la Mancomunidad del Sur en el Departamento de Guatemala.*

In the next months different Training sessions will be held in Haiti and Guatemala.

The conference aimed to discuss the latest innovative approaches to the use of ICTs in evaluation and featured best practices that have emerged from the experiences of development organizations and the private sector across the world. The conference set out to explore what is possible today, and what the future holds.
The ICT4Evaluation conference was organized around three main topics:
1. ICT applied to data collection
2. ICT applied to data analysis
3. ICT applied to data dissemination

![](/blogimages/P70606-113155-1024x758.jpg)

The Tech Fair, held in parallel to the conference, on 7 June, gave participants an opportunity a more hands-on experience of the technologies and services explored at the conference.

This made visible and facilitated a broader understanding of the technological opportunities that are available today.

		Content: `Infographic 1: Cash and voucher system

Cash and voucher system refers to a restricted number of tools, where the cash or voucher is given to individuals, households or communities, but not to governments or other state actors.

In certain humanitarian disasters, the supply of food to markets and shops is sustained, yet, the affected population loses the means to buy it. In such cases, the cash and voucher aid approach ensures humanitarian aid reaches directly those with the greatest need in a timely manner.

Cash and vouchers are quick to deliver, cost-effective and provide people in need with greater choice. Among its advantages are benefits for local economies, empowerment of the beneficiaries, dignity and decision power to people who can choose the items they would like to buy. The cash and voucher system has shown to help the morale of those in need and also prepares the ground for linking relief, rehabilitation and development (LRRD) activities.

Cash and vouchers can be spent on a variety of products but usually food, non-food items, fuel, blankets and other essentials are the first port of call for those who need support.

With the institutional shift from food aid to food assistance, [WFP ](http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/newsroom/wfp274576.pdf?_ga=2.16378677.2081798952.1499178432-1861972953.1499178432) now has three distinct transfer modalities for distributing resources to target beneficiaries:
Cash,
Vouchers,
Food in kind (in-kind contribution and/or procured).

Cash and vouchers, together with food, provide WFP with additional flexibility in responding to hunger and nutrition issues, and allow the organization to tailor a food assistance response to the needs of beneficiaries – including those with special needs – and their contexts (i.e. what is possible, acceptable and/or feasible in a given situation), facilitating their access to available food in the local markets

The diversification of transfer modality options requires: (i) a systematic analysis of markets to determine suitability of a market based response; and (ii) a better understanding of the context through a series of sectoral capacity assessments. These will identify what is possible and feasible in a given context, and what is acceptable for beneficiaries in order to ensure that the chosen transfer modality is the most appropriate option.

The transfer modality consit of:
Cash trasnfers – monetary assistance in the form of physical cash or electronic disbursement to a targeted individual or household that enables direct access to food from the marketplace,
Voucher transfers – assistance to a targeted individual or household in the form of a paper or electronic entitlement reedemable at preselected retailers or at specifically organised fairs for a predifined list of commodities, but not for cash,
Food in-kind transfers – assistance to a targeted individual or household in the form of dry or wet rations.

The two main types of vouchers are:
Commodity voucher – redeemable for fixed quantities of specified foods,
Value voucher – redeemable for a choice of specified food items with the equivalent cash value of the voucher. 

Furthermore, there are two voucher distribution models:
Paper voucher – The beneficiary receives paper coupons and/or a scratch card that has a commodity or monetary value and that can be exchanged at contracted retailers or at specifically organized fairs. Both cash and commodity vouchers can be exchanged for items or services, but not for cash. Paper vouchers are distributed on a monthly basis and have a predefined validity period. 
Electronic voucher – Electronic vouchers (e-vouchers) carry information on the monetary value of assistance or items and quantities they can be exchanged for on a barcode, a magnetic band or microchip on the card, or by short message service (SMS). Electronic voucher instruments (bank card, cell phone, SCOPECARD, etc.) are issued to beneficiaries only once, whereas their redemption value or quantity is credited remotely at predefined temporal intervals.

Access to information is crucial in family farming, which is known to be heterogeneous, primarily family-based labour, production of highly diversified products, and limited access to productive resources.

ICTs, especially mobile applications, are playing key role in facilitating access to these resources by the poor. The "digital financial services" revolution has huge implication on family farmers.

With the increasing penetration of mobile phones in remote parts of the world, efforts should then be made to strengthen the innovative use of mobile technologies by family farmers. Combination of mobile technology and geographic information system provide accurate, specific/micro information of soil, water, nutrient etc. on farmers' field for decision making.

Creating the enabling environments for rural ICT connectivity through sound policies and strategies and ensuring thereby affordable and quality access to the technologies, especially in rural areas, will support smooth exchange of agricultural information for family farms. ICT strategies and platforms that increase involvement of farmers' organizations in policy development, policy debates, and influencing policy implementation have to be promoted.

In 2013, Gnucoop developed for [Action Contre la Faim](http://www.actioncontrelafaim.org/) a mobile-web application to monitor prices of basic food items available in Central African Republic markets. Food prices are usually collected by different organizations working in different areas. 

This platform, based on [ODK ](https://opendatakit.org/)data collection application, gathers information from different sources into a unique system.

They strongly believed that the combination of technical competencies with development skills would have given international cooperation projects a better chance to be successful. Gnucoop dedicates a considerable part of its work to activities aiming at providing customized IT solutions and technical assistance to INGOs, UN Agencies and Humanitarian Aid Organisations, supporting them in achieving their purposes.
At the beginning, the understanding of the specific language used by developers, the existence of many acronyms, technical terms, simple words used with a completely different meaning didn’t make easy our work.
During project implementation we had to use many different tools specific for a Software Development project (i.e. project management platform for agile developers, web-based hosting service for source code).
Step by step, project by project, testing by testing, we discovered a new world and now we can say that part of nerds language is also our language.

The merger of these two worlds, which look far from each other in the collective imagination, is our strength. This combination which links nerds, always represented working alone in a tiny room under the light of their PC, and Humanitarian workers, always travelling around the world and surrounded by people, made Gnucoop an uncommon Software House.

For those reasons, it’s a pleasure to share the [Digital Development Glossary](http://www.ictworks.org/2017/03/02/the-digital-development-glossary-your-key-to-ict4d-buzzwords/) made by ICTworks and we would like to add some keywords we have already treated in our blog:

[E-voucher](https://www.gnucoop.com/cash-and-vouchers-a-new-way-to-respond-to-hunger-and-nutrition-issues/): Electronic vouchers (e-vouchers) carry information on the monetary value of assistance or items. They can be exchanged through a barcode, a magnetic band or microchip on a card, or by short message service (SMS). Electronic voucher tools (bank card, cell phone, SCOPECARD, etc.) are issued to beneficiaries only once, whereas their refund value or quantity is remotely credited at predefined temporal intervals.

[GIS platform](https://www.gnucoop.com/gis-platform-for-disaster-risk-reduction/): GIS software systems have been used for more than three decades by humanitarian organisations, researchers, and policy makers in order to activate quick responses to natural disasters, to detect early outbreaks of infectious diseases, target development resources, and for public infrastructure planning, such as hospitals and clinics.

And probably the most important issue for us..

[Free software](http://www.gnu.org/): Free software means users have four essential freedoms: users can run the program, study and change the program in source code form, redistribute exact copies and distribute modified versions.
Free software gives the possibility of re-using software code, editing and sharing with the community the improvements made to the software code.

An  operating system composed by  free software means that it respects users' freedom

Since its foundation Gnucoop has always believed that no real innovation comes without knowledge sharing.`,

Agriculture is the mainstay of national economies and household incomes in many African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.
The role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture is truly significant in everything, from conserving water use to helping secure the livelihoods of rural women. The huge potential of ICT for agriculture (ICT4Ag), from increasing agricultural yields to helping farmers to get a fairer price for their produce, is well documented. Technologies such as SMS applications, mobile banking and satellite data have been used successfully in order to give agricultural stakeholders access to farm mapping, weather data, marketing tools, financial credit, advice from extension workers, and social networks, among other things.
What Gnucoop can offer:

**SMS-based service:**
We propose the use of an SMS-based platform providing agricultural advice, weather forecasts, market prices, markets location and calendar to farmers. It uses data and insights on farmers, crops, markets and prices to provide commercial data and intelligence services to agribusinesses and financial organisations.
SMS trade and market information service is a simple, convenient and cost-effective service that is helping farmers in rural areas to search for market for their produce at better prices within their regions and beyond
Market information services (MIS) delivered through mobile phone SMS platforms help to increase household incomes, to reduce marketing costs and to improve the social welfare of small-scale farmers.

**Data Collection Web and Mobile Platform:**
Our web-based platform allows to collect, store and manage any kind of data. This application allows to collect data and compile entry forms in a user-friendly way, analyse and generate reports at different levels: from single sites to country offices up to regional and HQ level.
Data collection is done using different tools, from paper to digital forms and mobile apps.
The last version of our platform provides a more advanced, modern and modular software; only one interface for data entry; data safety and clear user management structure; a user-friendly and customizable interface; a modular and extendible system.
Thanks to the use of Angular JS 2 it can work offline guaranteeing offline updates if no connection is available but it would also make the whole system more uniform and centralized, therefore reducing the maintenance costs and the incidence of bugs, increasing the quality of the web application. Though the web app it’s possible to generate standard and customized reports, where users can define what information to include as well as the layout and format to display it. It is possible to analyze data and display related graphs or info-graphs for a better monitoring of the project activities.

**GIS Platform:**
GIS application in agriculture has been playing an increasingly important role in crop production throughout the world by helping farmers in increasing production, reducing costs, and managing their land resources more efficiently. GIS application in agriculture such as agricultural mapping plays a vital role in monitoring and management of soil and irrigation of any given farm land.
Gnucoop developed a webGIS platform, called Yago, to locate resources, identify critical issues, design urban plans and understand local vulnerabilities in order to increase population preparedness towards natural disasters and help managing crisis.
It’s a modern and light software that can also run on smartphones and tablets, developed using the Google framework Angular 4 Google and libraries for the development of mobile-friendly Leaflet interactive maps.
Yago is a webGIS application that allows uploading and overlapping geo datasets in order to identify vulnerable areas, risk and hazards.
We’re developing a new functionality who allows to enter directly some data on a map, through a specific interface.

Gnucoop can also been carry out field missions to test the application, and monitor the roll out and deployment of the developed application, as well as to train local staff on the use of the system. The system will be implemented in many different countries with thousands of users.`,

		Excerpt:      "",
		Content: `A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.

![](/blogimages/chatbot.jpeg)

The chatbot technology has the potential to be an innovative tool for development and humanitarian organizations to better communicate with their beneficiaries. The ability to deploy a scaled outreach campaign while not heavily burdening staff with regards to time and training has the potential to be one invaluable use of chatbots to development organizations with and without an ICT focus.

Chatbots smartly guide beneficiaries and other end users through surveys, making the surveys easier to understand and complete correctly. There are options for additional functionality using artificial intelligence and machine learning in the interpretation of messages and sending of information.

Smartphones and chatbots have made services from banking to transportation more accessible across Africa. Now, aid agencies are hoping they can do the same with food.

The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) routinely carries out food security analysis in order to assess and track the need for food assistance in its areas of operation. WFP maintains a network of 1.5o food security analysts who work with governments to implement surveys of household food security and markets. WFP commonly implements comprehensive and emergency food security assessments as well as market assessments and facilitates or maintains food security monitoring systems in many of its countries of presence.

In the last year WFP has also experimented with chatbot-based survey.  

Chatbots will not be the solution to all problems, but simply another ICT tool that has the potential to deliver value with a thoughtful approach and proper design and development.

These include: ensuring us of who owns what; validating transactions; or verifying that a given piece of information is true”.

UN leaders calls startups working with blockchain and other technologies to focus their attention to improve digital identities.
But there are many other areas of application of blockchain for development aid. WFP for example is using blockchain in Jordan’s Azraq camp. In the pilot project, called  “Building Blocks”, 10,000 refugees are now able to pay for their food by means of entitlements recorded on a blockchain-based computing platform and Robert Opp, WFP’s Director of Innovation and Change Management, said “Blockchain technology allows us to step up the fight against hunger”. “Through blockchain, we aim to cut payment costs, better protect beneficiary data, control financial risks, and respond more rapidly in the wake of emergencies. Using blockchain can be a qualitative leap – not only for WFP, but for the entire humanitarian community”, he added.

![](/blogimages/IMG_20171110_091858-1024x758.jpg)
This step involves six Countries, such as Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya and South Sudan, which have started to use the platform during October and November 2017.

After the first step, in the next few months, the platform will be roll out to the other Countries in which UNHCR is working. In the meantime, Gnucoop is providing support to those six Countries in the training of the medical staff about the use of the web app.
Our Project Manager, Paola Fava, has been involved in the training, installation and tablets allocation in the refugee camps of Gihembe and Nyabiheke, in Rwanda. The training has been held in Kigali and according to her, it was a successful experience.

		Content: `The last training session in the 5th pilot Country has been held in South Sudan, Maban County. Several refugee camps are currently located in Maban. They are largely occupied by people fleeing armed conflict in [Sudan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan)'s [Blue Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Nile_(state)) and [South Kordofan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Kordofan) States. The largest camps are from west to east: Kaya, Yusuf Batil (locally known as Batil), Gendrassa (directly abutting Batil) and [Doro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doro,_South_Sudan) (near the town of Bunj). The camps were initially supported by the [World Food Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme), originally through food air drops, although as on 2013, the UN Refugee Agency ([UNHCR](http://data.unhcr.org/SouthSudan/country.php?id=251)) and several other NGOs started to provide more stable relief services.
![](/blogimages/Gendrassa-camp-1024x417.png)
Gendrassa Camp.
The Maban UNHCR Health and Nutrition team has involved the NGOs working in the Health sector ([Samaritan’s Purse](https://www.samaritanspurse.org/), [International Medical Corps](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/country/south-sudan/), [Medair](http://www.medair.org/en/countries/south-sudan/), [Relief International](https://www.ri.org/reach/africa/south-sudan)) for whom we held 3 days of training. The training was really successful, thanks to the enthusiastic involvement of the participants. They were really well prepared people who are dedicating their life to the Sudanese Refugees who left their country and found a place to stay in South Sudan, another country afflicted by a civil war from 2014. They divided their time from the clinics to the NGO compound, where they spent time working on the reports of the day. The idea of using tablets and the chance of creating reports automatically, made them really happy.
![](/blogimages/training-3.png)
We spent the second week visiting all the clinics and health posts they managed in the 4 refugee camps and the 2 hospitals outside the camps, which serve also the host community. We collected all the information necessary for the following pilot project. Indeed, in march 2018, they will leave paper in order to use only tablet for the data collection. Some of the clinics are in good conditions and well equipped, some other need to be rehabilitated, because working there it’s not easy. Maban County is quite difficult to be reached, especially for receiving building materials. They serve more than 100 refugees per day, giving health and nutrition support and they sincerely expressed their difficulties to work in these conditions.
![](/blogimages/Clinic-2.png)
We spent lot of time with all the people involved in the Health and Nutrition sector, UNHCR staff and NGOs local staff, we could learn many things. Having  time for visiting all the clinics in four different camps, having the possibility to talk to people and collecting information directly from the field about the situation in that country has been a really great experience.
![](/blogimages/Clinic-3.png)
The situation in the country is still really dramatic and complicate. Marking four years since the outbreak of South Sudan’s civil war, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, on 13th December 2017, appealed for “urgent action by all sides to settle the conflict and put an end to the country’s deepening humanitarian crisis and Africa’s largest refugee crisis”. Noting that 63 percent of all South Sudanese refugees are under 18, Grandi labelled the situation “a children’s refugee crisis” and stressed that: “many children are arriving unaccompanied, separated and deeply traumatised.” Refugee women arriving in neighbouring countries have also reported repeated rape, the killing of their husbands, and abduction of their children. The six countries neighbouring South Sudan host two million refugees, while nearly seven million citizens inside the country are in need of essential humanitarian assistance. Two million of these are internally displaced. Despite this tragic situation, the South Sudanese staff we met showed us a great desire to work together and to do their job in the best possible way.
Thank you guys! `,

The workshop is one of the activity included in the University Course in Public and Political Communication ([Corso di laurea magistrale in Comunicazione pubblica e politica](http://www.didattica-cps.unito.it/do/home.pl/View?doc=corsi_di_studio/CPP_comunicazione_pubblica/presentazione.html)), that helps students to get familiar and acquire knowledge and skills about the use of communication  and ICT tools in the development sector.

![](/blogimages/unito0-1-1024x491.jpg)

The workshop included 6 sessions and  Gnucoop was invited to participate as a lecturer to one of the lessons, focusing on the use of ICT for development.

Gnucoop discussed about the use of ICT in the development sector and particularly on how free software and technology can be useful tools to improve the impact of developing projects in international cooperation. Also, Gnucoop provided an overview and examples of ICT4D applications, such as mobile data collection tools, web GIS applications and blockchain solutions.

All the mentioned tools have the double role of gathering/disseminating information as well as helping responders to take actions. 

Furthermore key challenges and best practices in ICT4D have been presented and discussed such as:

- Sustainability: ensuring project longevity →  crucial involvement of government or local ownership;
- Scalability: from pilot to large scale project: → ability to propose a solution that can impact large population
- Evaluation: impact analysis → keep monitoring the application year after year

The class involved students from the university of Turin enrolled specifically  in communication and development studies, who were very interested and actively participated to the session. 

At the end of the workshop, students have been asked to run a practical exercise and design a communication plan related to the cooperation and development sector. `,

She completed her stage few days ago, and here what he left to us....

Thank you Zoe! And than you for your enthusiasm!

For the past two and a half months, I have spent my summer abroad living in Milan, Italy, working for the internationally acclaimed IT non-profit Gnucoop. Gnucoop provides free, secure, and reliable data platforms for information collection services in developing countries, making possible the digitization of information from the start (whether it be resource distribution or identification statistics). In working with this company, I have learned much more than I ever anticipated, developing hard and soft skills that will stick with me for the rest of my life. I worked with colleagues to compose, review, and revise Brief Summaries, Business Informational Reports, and Grant Proposals/ Applications. Throughout this process, I had to analyze data platforms, geo-level map indicators, and block chain solutions. Understanding the steps necessary to collect, aggregate, monitor, and report &amp; share data. When dealing with clients, such as the UNHCR, UN Refugee Agency, and UNICEF, it is crucial to be consistent and clear: presenting the features and implementations of hash maps and customizable indicators is not always accomplished in the most concise manner. This internship has taught me how to analyze extended reports and reproduce them in simplified versions without taking away from the original meaning. The Gnucoop team does a phenomenal job of marketing and advertising their complex company message in a clean and clear light. Additionally, I designed and created the Gnucoop sector based logos, infographics, flyers, and social-media posts. To do so, I had to participate in many conference calls and gain a basic understanding of data-science engineering to remain consistent with the company concept design. Leading the graphic design initiative for Gnucoop was both an honor and a horror story, because of the acknowledgement to my skill and my initial fear of failure. Like any new intern, I was nervous and scared of rejection. By the end of my internship, though, it was learning how to accept myself as a creator and have confidence in my work that imposed in me notions of self-worth and pride that I will cherish forever. Without Gnucoop and the roles to which they assigned me, I do not know if I ever would have truly valued myself as an artist. In performing such tasks, I am now more confident in my Writing in Business skills as well as mastery of both Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator.

A characteristic of this company that cannot be left unsaid is its welcoming nature. Not a single day did I feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed with my role in the company. I was certainly kept busy, but never to an extent where I felt I could not manage the tasks at hand. I attribute this optimism to my enjoyment and excitement for working with Gnucoop. Being a part of this team was as amusing and entertaining as it was challenging, constantly being pushed as well as non-stop laughing with my co-workers—making me feel right at home. Gnucoop embodies a perfect balance of intense software engineering with playful, open-minded collaboration. Every aspect of my internship taught me something new, and I will use this exposure and knowledge as a vehicle to further my pursuits in international business and networking. I am thankful for these lessons, some of which arrived from relationships built with colleagues, involvement in international business, and a growing understanding of Italian NGO and co-op working culture. All of the respect my fellow colleagues gave to me motivated me to give just the same in return. I will carry with me this attitude, as I prepare for my return to the United States to embark on my next business journey, curious to see where these incomparable skills will take me.

		Content: `What do the ancient astronomer Taqi ad-Din, the well known scientific communicator Neil deGrasse Tyson, and the father of modern statistics, Sir Francis Galton, have in common? Their life is tightly bound with data analysis, as almost everything in our "data explosion" times, should be. The era of guessing is rapidly declining, when the data-driven paradigms are more and more on the rise. Gnucoop, being a data oriented software company from the very beginning, stays true to it's origins. During the last Gnumeeting, an entire day was dedicated to an extended overview of the Data Science discipline, for all our team. I was delighted to introduce my colleagues to all the bolts and nuts of this fascinating, almost magic, activity called Machine Learning. 
Starting with some historical anecdotes on how a wrong data interpretation could, and in fact did lead to some disastrous outcomes, we moved on experiencing how fascinating the data visualization could be. I always suggest to make a peek at David McCandless marvelous project called "[informationisbeautiful.net](http://informationisbeautiful.net)". It's the best place to quickly understand how much information could be delivered to us, with simple visualization techniques, instead of using pure language.
![](/blogimages/one-1024x708.jpg)
Next we moved to the real core of the data analysis, taking a look at the data cleaning activity and some basic models like Linear Regression, applied on some standard datasets from Kaggle. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is de facto the place to go for every data enthusiast, being the main platform both for education and competitions in data science, setting all the reference benchmarks for the best models around. 
Our data-garden was next enriched by Decision Trees, creating a Random Forest (pun intended). All our products and projects will expand on existing decision support systems, leveraging all our data gathering tools, and Machine Learning techniques going forward with all this rapid developing field.
![](/blogimages/two.jpg)

Data analysis made some huge leaps in the last years, allowing software not only to see, but also to understand what is looking at. We analyzed some data sets for Classification problems, making our model actually distinguish between entities, being it some lexical notions, as in Natural Language Processing  techniques, or plain pictures containing subjects. There are several tools at our disposition for the task, from some simple Probability Models to some more advanced Convolutional Neural Networks. In conclusion we did test some other techniques regarding Time Series analysis for pattern recognition. As usual one can only predict efficiently an event which is generated from some discovered strong patterns, otherwise we go back to guessing.
![](/blogimages/Post-Niko-1.png)
Artificial intelligence should and will enhance all those social interventions already done by thousands of people in the most critical areas of the globe, and I believe actually it is the best field where AI should be deployed. Using learning networks in video games is fun. Selling the right burger to the right person is nice. But what about those situations where time is not an option, nor errors are allowed. Situations where life itself depends on fast and precise reaction of those who can help. Here at Gnucoop our daily effort is committed towards deploying every useful technology, from computer vision to neural networks, from language processing to block-chain, in order to help equality, collaboration and justice. `,

Fig.1 iRHIS Landing page

The mobile and web application designed to collect and report refugees medical records is up and running with a renovated look and it’s currently being used in 4 countries: Tanzania, Rwanda, Zambia and Ethiopia, involving over 1300 users and serving over 355.700 refugees.
While Tanzania, Rwanda and Zambia have also participated to the pilot phase, the system has been introduced to Ethiopia only in the last month, where over 500 new users have started to collect data.
While Data is collected daily and mostly offline on tablets by health staff, data synchronization and aggregation is performed weekly to update indicators on dashboard, reports and landing page. In some locations, such as in 2 Refugee camps in Zambia and one camp in Kenya, individual data collection has not been possible due to internal constraints. In order to overcome the challenge, the system provides the possibility to also enter already aggregated data directly into the application using a specific online form at health facility level. 
Once information has been entered into the system, dashboard, reports and landing page allow easily monitoring of mortality, morbidity, reproductive health, diseases surveillance, Epi and nutritional indicators. 
The landing page, that is publicly available,  displays indicator values at country and camp levels. The picture below shows pie charts (Fig.2) about the top five causes of morbidity in 6 Rwandese Refugee camps, grouped by disease type ( Acute Health Conditions, Chronic Diseases, Injuries, Mental Health Disease)

The dashboard is also a key element of the iRHIS system. Displayed data is based on users’ permissions and Figure 4 shows some dashboard indicators (population, morbidity and mortality) related to Kiziba Refugee camp in Rwanda.
![](/blogimages/Fig4-1024x252.png)
Fig. 4: Dashboard for Kiziba camp- week 30 2018

A great advantage of the system is that not only camp, country or regional supervisors but also clinicians at health center level can view updated indicators directly on their dashboard on their tablets. This helps them to always have a clear picture of the current status of the Health Facility or Camp where they work in. Furthermore, they can see their data collection efforts being used to generate valuable information.
Also reports are automatically generated weekly. They provide a comprehensive overview of public health and wash indicators at refugee camp level. Figure 5 and 6 show some examples of iRHIS reports.

In the coming months, the system will be constantly monitored to improve its performance and facilitate the roll out in other countries. In August, Sudan will be added to the list of implementing countries. Particularly, next week health staff from 7 camps in Easter Sudan will be trained on the use of the new system.
We’ll continue keeping you posted on future updates of the project! Stay tuned!`,

Alla collaborazione tra più soggetti è in particolare dedicato l’Obiettivo 17 degli SDGs “Partnership for the Goals”, anche prevista dall’articolo 208 del Trattato di Lisbona3.
Le Imprese possono contribuire allo sviluppo di progetti di cooperazione internazionale, soprattutto attraverso forme di partenariato con soggetti terzi, tra cui ONG e partner locali, nel pieno rispetto dei principi di CSR e delle linee guida OCSE4.
Nel 2017 abbiamo avuto quindi l'opportunità di partecipare al Bando OSC Paesi partner dell'Agenzia Italiana per la Cooperazione allo Sviluppo in partnership con [Mani Tese](http://www.manitese.org) per la presentazione di un progetto Agricolo in Mozambico, nella Provincia della Zambezia.
La Provincia della Zambezia, area d’intervento del progetto Quelimane agricola, è una delle più povere del Paese: dati della World Bank del 2016 stimano che il 70% della popolazione zambeziana si trovi sotto la soglia di povertà e che in tale provincia e in quella di Nampula siano residenti la metà (48%) dei poveri del Paese.
Il settore agricolo è la base dell’economia del Nord del Mozambico e dà lavoro all’80% della popolazione attiva. Per questo motivo, la promozione dello sviluppo di un sistema di mercato agricolo rappresenterebbe il principale strumento per ridurre la povertà generando sviluppo sostenibile.
Il progetto, cofinanziato da [AICS](https://www.aics.gov.it/), si propone di contribuire allo sviluppo rurale sostenibile della provincia della Zambezia attraverso il rafforzamento del sistema agroalimentare locale e dei suoi principali attori: produttori, settore privato e autorità locali.
Sarà promossa, in particolare, l’adozione di pratiche innovative e sostenibili in materia di produzione, marketing e consumo dei prodotti agricoli.
Le attività da noi implementate saranno le seguenti:
Identificazione e sviluppo di una piattaforma tecnologica opensource che faciliti l’informazione e la comunicazione tra i produttori agricoli su meteo, dinamiche di prezzi, alert system per fiere, eventi e mercati.
I produttori, pur possedendo – nella maggior parte dei casi – un cellulare (anche se spesso non smartphone e quindi senza connessione ad internet) non riescono ad essere al corrente, in tempo reale, di informazioni per loro fondamentali come le condizioni meteo, l’andamento dei prezzi dei prodotti che coltivano e la presenza di eventi/fiere nei mercati di prossimità e/o nei loro distretti.
Per far fronte a questo limite, l’iniziativa adotta un approccio ad hoc di innovazione sociale digitale che prevede l’uso della tecnologia per risolvere problemi ambientali e sociali promuovendo, allo stesso tempo, nuove collaborazioni tra settore pubblico, settore privato e terzo settore.
Il servizio SMS sarà presentato alle istituzioni locali e proposto alle compagnie telefoniche funzionanti in loco per l’attivazione di un possibile accordo di  partenariato che ne possa ulteriormente ridurre i costi - in un’ottica di partnership win-win di responsabilità sociale d’impresa.
Sviluppo di una piattaforma di raccolta e analisi dei dati relativi al progetto e per monitoraggio delle attività.
Gli aspetti presi in considerazione saranno di carattere quantitativo e qualitativo. La raccolta dei dati sarà garantita da una risorsa dedicata all’interno dello staff locale (M&amp;E Officer) che si occuperà, col coordinatore del progetto e il consulente incaricato della valutazione, della baseline survey per poi proseguire alla verifica dell’andamento delle attività attraverso la raccolta trimestrale dei dati.

## Case Study: Cash Distribution in Libya

In certain remote and marginalized areas in countries, such as Libya, international staff are prohibited entry.
E-vouchers are the only possible method to provide salaries and reimbursements to the local staff, who are responsible for both implementing the activities and monitoring the cash distribution in these areas.
Project description
Libya is notorious for its political instability that restricts, and under some circumstances, denies the civilian population access to fundamental rights, such as healthcare and education. Thousands of people do not have access to health care and medication is scarce. The Ministry of Health recently reported that only 60% of Libyan hospitals are partially or completely in operation; the majority of the country’s medical personnel have fled the country, and the few remaining doctors lack the tools and resources to work safely. A recent analysis of the capacity of the Libyan health sector, promoted by the World Health Organization, shows that out of a total of 1656 health facilities, 17% of hospitals and 20.1% of first aid centers are not functioning.
[*Helpcode*](http://helpcode.org) intervention promotes an emergency intervention service in the Fezzan region, in the province of Ubari, within 4 health centers. The *Helpcode* objective is to improve health services for vulnerable groups, including both residents and migrants. Since long ago, Libyan authorities have neglected the Region of Fezzan: even today, the site remains largely marginalized within the national territory.
In the province of Ubari alone there are about 20,000 individuals in need of humanitarian assistance. The most vulnerable groups are those comprised of internally displaced people: wherein Al-Aweinat, Ghat, Murzu, Sabah and Tuyuri 4,000 can be found. The additional 8,000 people that have returned to their homes are also identified as vulnerable.
*Helpcode* collaborates with *Terre des Hommes* and *STACO*, one of the most important and structured Libyan NGOs, to rehabilitate health centers, distribute medicines and medical material, and train specialized health personnel.
This intervention is part of an initiative in Libya that is led by *Italian Cooperation*. In October of 2016, *Italian Cooperation* concluded an agreement with the area representatives to allow for the sending of emergency aid to hospitals located in all five provinces of the Fezzan.
Blockchain solution
As we have said, health facilities have been severely damaged or destroyed, and medicine and drugs are in short supply. Only 60% of hospitals are in operation and rely entirely on WHO for the procurement of essential drugs. Most of the medical personnel have fled the country, and the doctors who have remained have no diagnostic tools or resources to work safely. There are no nurses, midwives, nor technicians.
In total, the remote areas in Al-Aweinat, Ghat, Murzu, Sabah, and Tuyuri encompass 90,000 people in need of help, of whom 40,000 are internally displaced. At least one-third of these are children.
The longer this crisis continues, the greater the number of people in need of care, thereby increasing the demand for medical services and drugs.
Blockchain technology is used for sending money. Money to support medical and nursing staff. Since traditional money transfers are impossible in Libya, we use Blockchain technology.
The mechanism for sending funds is relatively simple. Though, the behind-the-scenes work uses innovative technology.
Beneficiaries are identified (e.g. medical and nursing staff)
An individual manages and distributes the funds to the beneficiaries (by receiving "merkur", the cryptocurrency used for this transfer, and converting the sum into dinars)
Merchants use mobile phones for SMS data recording, and print receipts when connected to WIFI.
*How does it work?*
The beneficiary (doctor, nurse, obstetrician, etc.) is entered into our system. He/she sends an SMS to request funds.
The request is checked with a security procedure and is approved.
The distribution manager and the beneficiaries are notified of its approval.
The final beneficiaries collect their money from the person in charge of distribution.
Guaranteed monitoring and transparency:
Double data control
Real-time monitoring of financial exposure
Each transaction and its data are cryptographically stored
Everything is monitored by the *Helpcode* staff through the http://merkur.io/ platform.

I remembered the first time I found the first Facebook post of this community, and it immediately caught my attention, in few days this community became very big!
It was September 2015, few days before Europe has met the young Alan Kurdi (Kurdish: Alan Kurdî‎), initially reported as Aylan Kurdi, a three-year-old Syrian boy of Kurdish ethnic background, whose image made global headlines after he drowned on 2 September 2015 in the Mediterranean Sea. He and his family were [Syrian refugees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugees_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War) trying to reach Europe amid the [European refugee crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_refugee_crisis). Photographs of his body were taken by [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people) [journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist) [Nilüfer Demir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nil%C3%BCfer_Demir) and quickly spread around the world, prompting international responses.
Thanks to [Techfugees](http://techfugees.com) everybody discovered how big was the tech community who was doing something to face the Refugee “crisis” but, first of all, was trying to support the Refugees who are arriving in Europe.
![](/blogimages/IMG_20181025_134811-1024x768.jpg)
After three years now the Community is very active, composed by a very big variety of actors, from volunteers working in small projects in support of groups of Refugees, like [Kabubu](https://www.kabubu.fr) to [Google for Startups ](https://startup.google.com/), who funded the 2018 Techfugees Summit.
This second edition of Global Summit focused on the challenges newcomers face as they settle into their new host societies, and what role technology can take in breaking down barriers and building bridges to enable inclusion. 
Many have been the panels in program, from Access to Rights and Information to Data Ethics and Social Inclusion.
![](/blogimages/IMG_20181025_170142-2-1024x511.jpg)
It was so interesting to listen to the witnesses of Refugees who came in Europe and founded a company and now they are funding new ideas on the newcomers.
Many projects, many people, and few words in common: inclusion, data, identity….and blockchain.
Someone said Refugees are people who want to re-born, to start a new life and they can highlight the efficiency of our society and should be considered an opportunity.
Thanks to Technology that can support them and facilitate their integration, we can try to create a better life for them, and the collaboration between actors, like the participants of the summit, could be the right way to succeed.
Thank you again to Techfugees for this great opportunity!

We're looking for European organizations who are working with migrants and refugees for applying to a H2020 programme "Addressing the challenge of migrant integration through ICT-enabled solutions", if you're interested please contact us!`,

Abbiamo iniziato parlando di innovazione non come un risultato o un prodotto ma come un processo partecipativo di cui l’utente finale è il protagonista. 
E così sono stati riportati esempi di innovazione come [BRCK](https://www.brck.com/), che garantisce connettività in luoghi comunitari, come su 1000 autobus a Nairobi e 500 a Kigali, o in 1200 Wifi hotspots, oppure di imprese sociali nell’ambito dell’energia solare come la storia di [M-KOPA](http://www.m-kopa.com/) . 
Ma spesso basta poco per innovare, come un paio di tablet connessi che permette ad un gruppo di donne masai di imparare a leggere e scrivere e trasmettere all’intera comunità quanto appreso.

![](/blogimages/1_odi2019.jpg)

O ancora come il progetto Click4All ([https://www.click4all.com/en/](https://www.click4all.com/en/) ) per costruire piccoli strumenti di supporto alla disabilità (come mouse o tastiere), utilizzati per esempio in un centro di riabilitazione su base comunitaria in Siria. 
E tanti altri ancora…
E poi è arrivata la volta dei tavoli di co-design in tema di Educazione, Agricoltura e Salute. 
Gnucoop ha avuto il piacere di moderare il tavolo Health&amp;Tech. Quattro storie di innovazione sanitaria hanno aperto il dibattito: 
1. il software di raccolta dati del progetto [iRHIS - Gnucoop](https://his.unhcr.org/home); 
2. la piattaforma Open Hospital - [CUAMM/ISF](https://www.open-hospital.org/en/); 
3. la [participatory data physicalization](https://medium.com/we-are-sheldon/participatory-data-physicalization-a-new-space-to-design-health-care-informative-experiences-3912484f8e34) con l’Università di Bolzano;
4. i sistemi di mappatura che facilitano l’accesso a centri sanitari di riferimento di [CCM](http://www.ccm-italia.org/ita/africa/etiopia/progetti-conclusi/salute-materna-e-infantile-bale-regione-oromia/). 
Storie che hanno permesso di individuare gli ingredienti di successo e criticità dei progetti di innovazione come: partecipazione, formazione, raccolta ed umanizzazione dei dati ed, ancora, monitoraggio e replicabilità degli strumenti, etc…
Un momento concreto di scambio ed incontro tra le tre comunità cardine degli open days innovazione: operatori umanitari, innovatori ed imprese. 
Il secondo giorno ci ha visto invece partecipare a diversi workshops: dai Big Data e tecniche di data visualization ad esperienze pratiche sulle Internet of Things, tecnologie hardware open che danno spazio alla creatività ed innovazione. 
E poi si è parlato di project management e strumenti agile, di Kanban e di Scrum, di effetto Panopticon, sprint planning, retrospettiva, stand up meetings e dei tre ruoli chiavi dell’agile methodology (product owner, scrum master e  team members). Strumenti di progettazione e pianificazione che meglio si adattano a progetti innovativi, permettendo di tenere sotto controllo il progetto ed, allo stesso tempo, garantendo l’efficienza dei team di lavoro e minimizzando i rischi.

Gli #ODI2019 sono stati anche l'occasione per lanciare tutte le offerte formative di [#InnovazioneSviluppo](https://innovazionesviluppo.org/tutte-le-opportunit%C3%A0/formazionesviluppo/).
Fino al 20 Marzo sono aperte, tra le altre, le iscrizioni al primo ciclo del corso "From paper to tablet: all the steps you need to know" promosso da Gnucoop, [CIAI](https://www.ciai.it/) e ChangeLab. Il corso vuole fornire le competenze per migliorare il processo di monitoraggio e valutazione dei progetti e delle organizzazioni, attraverso l’utilizzo di strumenti adeguati ed innovativi di raccolta, sistematizzazione e analisi di dati.

That’s what happened last month when we took part to the first edition of the Master programme in ICT for Development and Social Good as lecturer of the ICT for Health module.
The Master course in [ICT for Development and Social Good](https://www.ictforsocialgoodmaster.eu/),  organized by [ONG2.0](http://www.ong2zero.org/en/) and the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/) and co-funded by the [Italian Agency for Cooperation and Development (AICS)](https://www.aics.gov.it/language/en/), allows students to acquire knowledge on managing projects in the cooperation and development sector with a special focus on the use of technology (ICT4D) to achieve project objectives.
![](/blogimages/ictforsocialgoodmaster.png)
In our ICT for Health module, we explored many topics, starting from a general overview of healthcare systems and health information systems, describing the processes and steps required to run a successful mhealth project. 
We discussed about many examples of mhealth applications: from remote monitoring, to point of care, stock management, treatment adherence, education/awareness and crowdsourcing. 
Each type of application has been analysed through practical case studies, allowing us to explore projects like *c-stock* for the management of drugs supply; to talk about the [*CardioPad*](https://himore-medical.com/) app from Cameroon for remote monitoring of cardiac diseases. We then presented applications like [*Momconnect*](http://www.health.gov.za/index.php/mom-connect) in SouthAfrica to support women during pregnancy and the very interesting [*Mobile Academy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_Q_McVe2uk&amp;feature=youtu.be) app where co-design with users really shows its full potential. And, again, we spoke about monitoring and tracking diseases using mobile application as well as crowdsourcing tools.
Students also had a chance to gain practical experience on some of the most common tools specifically used for mhealth projects such as CommCare, Magpi or TextIt. We also presented our Dewco data collection tool, developed by Gnucoop, that has been used, among others, for the development of the [Integrated Refugees Health Information System (iRHIS)](https://his.unhcr.org) used by UNHCR to monitor health activities in refugee camps at worldwide level.
![](/blogimages/kakuma_2.jpg)
So, talking about applications and mhealth tools implies a discussion about data and the common challenges of scalability, interoperability and data security. In our last lecture, we explored those challenges and possible solutions to overcome them. Furthermore, we walked through some basic concepts of data analysis like linear regression and decision tree with the overall objective of seeking good relations between our collected data.  `,

**Nell’ambito del corso “From Paper to Tablet”, 19 Settembre 2019 - H11-13, presso l’Istituto Beata Vergine Addolorata ([http://www.ibva.it](http://www.ibva.it)), Via Calatafimi 10 Milano**

La valutazione di impatto è ormai entrata a pieno titolo nella prassi ordinaria del lavoro nell’ambito della cooperazione allo sviluppo. Pur essendo sempre stata una componente essenziale del ciclo di vita del progetto, la valutazione riceve una rinnovata attenzione da parte di studiosi, donatori e ONG a partire da questo decennio. Inizialmente promossa come “buona pratica”, la valutazione è poi sostenuta dalle procedure stesse dei donatori. Ormai le parole “impatto” e “valutazione” veicolano la narrativa dello sviluppo un po’ come “sostenibilità” o “ownership” nei decenni scorsi. 

Un ruolo importante è certamente stato giocato dallo sviluppo tecnologico che ha reso possibile nel giro di pochi anni la raccolta di ingenti quantità di dati anche in contesti strutturalmente low-tech. Non è un caso che negli ultimi anni si sia assistito ad un fiorire di strumenti software per la raccolta, la gestione e l’elaborazione di dati in situazioni di connettività intermittente e con verticalizzazioni su tematiche specifiche, come salute o educazione. 

In questo nuovo rinascimento della valutazione restano però delle zone grigie che interrogano il mondo dello sviluppo e sembrano mettere in discussione la reale efficacia di questi esercizi che, in assenza di risposte, rischiano di essere relegati a mere prestazioni di stile. Come valutare l’impatto di lungo periodo con strumenti di finanziamento di breve termine? Come uscire dal circolo del progetto e valutare un programma o l’intera organizzazione? Come capitalizzare le valutazioni negative? Come scambiare la conoscenza acquisita tra diverse organizzazioni? Come coinvolgere tutti gli attori, compresi i beneficiari, in una valutazione?

Queste sono solo alcune delle domande alle quali cercheremo di iniziare a rispondere in un evento organizzato nell’ambito del corso di formazione “From paper to tablet”. L’evento sarà un seminario di confronto nel quale alcuni esperti di valutazione e data analysis porteranno il proprio punto di vista. Il dibattito sarà aperto a tutti gli attori della cooperazione internazionale.

Il valore dei dati fra nuove tecnologie, questioni etiche e innovazione sociale” organizzata da CIAI, Changelab e Gnucoop all’interno dell’iniziativa [“Innovazione per lo sviluppo”](https://innovazionesviluppo.org/)  di Fondazione Cariplo e Compagnia di S. Paolo.

Circa 40 persone hanno partecipato ad una mattinata di dibattito e approfondimento su temi che in questo momento si trovano al centro della discussione sulla cooperazione allo sviluppo. Sono intervenuti Federico Mento ([Social Value Italia](http://www.socialvalueitalia.it/)) Federico Bastia ([Fondazione Punto.sud](https://www.puntosud.org/)), Margherita Romanelli ([GVC-Weworld](https://www.weworld-gvc.it/it)) e Enrico Testi ([ARCOLab](http://www.arcolab.org)), moderati da Christian Elevati. 

La discussione si è aperta con la presentazione del questionario che era stato rivolto alle ONG nei giorni precedenti allo scopo di fotografare lo stato dell’arte sul tema valutazione e nuove tecnologie. Da questa indagine è emerso chiaramente come il lavoro da fare sia ancora molto, nonostante il tema della valutazione non sia certamente nuovo per le ONG. Tra i numerosi attori del terzo settore, infatti, le ONG sono fra quelli che da più tempo realizzano valutazioni spesso anche molto approfondite, sui propri interventi incoraggiante anche dai donatori stessi che nelle loro procedure le prevedono ormai in modo quasi sistematico.

Nonostante questo, la discussione ha permesso di mettere in evidenza alcune problematiche che ancora interrogano il mondo della cooperazione internazionale. Più precisamente: come è possibile passare dalla valutazione di un singolo progetto alla valutazione di un’organizzazione? E ancora, come passare dalla “misurazione” alla “gestione” dell’impatto? ovvero, come trasformare un esercizio valutativo in un vero momento di apprendimento? E poi, come possono, le tecnologie dell’informazione, facilitare questi processi, o addirittura renderli possibili?

E’ chiaro che tali questioni riguardano l’intero ecosistema della cooperazione, dai donatori, ai beneficiari, passando per l’opinione pubblica e i media. L’impressione è che nella risposta a tali questioni si nasconda non poco del futuro della cooperazione internazionale ed è prevedibile che delle risposte potranno essere identificate soltanto all’interno di un percorso di almeno medio periodo. Un elemento importante in questo percorso sarà la capacità delle ONG di proporre loro stesse dei modelli innovativi di valutazione che siano efficienti, economici e tecnologicamente al passo con i tempi, andando oltre un approccio di mera compliance.

E’ proprio questa impostazione che il corso [“From Paper to Tablet”](https://academy.gnucoop.com/course/view.php?id=2) cerca di proporre, fornendo gli strumenti concreti per affrontare la valutazione con spirito rinnovato.

## Intro

Per questo progetto la sfida è stata quella di identificare correttamente il genere maschile o femminile dei bambini fotografati all’interno di un’aula scolastica. La scelta è stata di usare le reti neurali artificiali, attingendo al ricco strumentario open-source in materia di Deep Learning.
L’attività descritta è un problema di “classificazione”, in quanto abbiamo due classi (maschi e femmine) alle quali è possibile associare una data immagine.

## Ricerca del modello

Nella tecnica Deep Learning, la classificazione di un’immagine non è altro che l’applicazione di un filtro multistrato ad essa. Il campo di ricerca su questo argomento è molto attivo, e vi sono vari modelli in circolazione, rilasciati sia dalle società commerciali come Google o Microsoft, sia dal settore universitario come Visual Geometry Group della università di Oxford. Come molti dei nostri progetti, anche il progetto in questione si svolge in un contesto con delle costrizioni sia di potenza dei dispositivi, sia di una scarsa connettività, quindi la scelta del modello da adottare è ricaduta naturalmente sul MobileNet proposto da Google. E’ un modello particolarmente efficiente ed al tempo stesso leggero, solo 17Mb rispetto ai modelli standard che si aggirano sulle centinaia di Mb.
Il modello, detto a  Reti Neurali Convolute, o ConvNet (CNN) sono uno degli algoritmi di Deep Learning più utilizzati oggi nella computer vision, e trovano applicazione in tantissimi campi, dalle automobili autonome ai droni, dalle diagnosi mediche al supporto e trattamento per gli ipovedenti.
![](/blogimages/image11.jpg)
Come per ogni problema di machine learning, per allenare una rete vi è il bisogno di fornire molti dati. Questi dati verranno utilizzati dal modello stesso, per parametrizzare i propri nodi interni, arrivando a capire quali caratteristiche sono determinanti per una classe e quali invece non lo sono. Ad esempio per distinguere un maschio da una femmina potrebbe essere utile considerare la grandezza relativa degli occhi, mentre invece sarebbe inutile considerare il colore della pelle. Queste astrazioni vengono scoperte in automatico dalla rete neurale, in un processo detto *allenamento. *Per raccogliere i dati necessari siamo andati a direttamente sul campo.

## Raccolta delle immagini

![](/blogimages/image3.jpg)
Sono state raccolte circa 2000 fotografie, tramite due macchine fotografiche digitali: una per le femmine, ed una per i maschi. In questo modo siamo stati sicuri di effettuare una classificazione già all’origine, cosa non banale da fare a posteriori con un operatore umano.

## Modifica della rete

2000 fotografie non sono assolutamente sufficienti per allenare una rete neurale robusta, ma per nostra fortuna esiste una tecnica chiamata Transfer Learning che permette un ulteriore allenamento di un modello già allenato in precedenza.   
Il modello MobileNet è stato allenato con il database di immagini classificate ImageNet, composto da più di 14 milioni di immagini con le relative classi, cosa che ha permesso al modello di apprendere quali sono quelle caratteristiche di base che fanno distinguere un entità da un altra. Caratteristiche come le forme geometriche ad esempio. Al termine del caricamento avevamo un modello con 89 strati sequenziali.
![](/blogimages/image7.jpg)

## Allenamento

A questo punto abbiamo effettuato un ulteriore allenamento sugli ultimi 20 strati del modello, per aggiustarlo al nostro contesto ed alle nostre immagini.
Le immagini raccolte sul campo attraversano in sequenza tutti 89 filtri, diventando sempre più astratte, perdendo senso per noi umani, ma acquistando senso per la rete neurale.
![](/blogimages/Image-2019-10-01-at-9.00.30-AM.png)

## Risultati

I nostri risultati si aggirano su un’accuratezza del 94%. Ci aspettiamo comunque di migliorare questo risultato raccogliendo più dati in fase di esecuzione del progetto. Di seguito il risultato su un insieme di 183 immagini mai viste dal modello in fase di allenamento.

		Content: `Con la terza edizione di Milano si chiude il corso [“From Paper to Tablet”](https://academy.gnucoop.com/course/view.php?id=2), promosso da Gnucoop, [ChangeLab](https://www.info-cooperazione.it/home-changelab/) e [CIAI](http://www.ciai.it) e finanziato da [Fondazione Cariplo](http://fondazionecariplo.it/it/index.html) e [Compagnia di S. Paolo](https://compagniadisanpaolo.it/) all’interno del programma [Innovazione per lo Sviluppo](https://innovazionesviluppo.org/). Alle tre edizioni, due a Milano e una a Bologna, hanno partecipato quasi 60 persone di 50 organizzazioni. Principalmente ONG e altri soggetti della cooperazione internazionale, ma anche persone attive nel terzo settore in Italia. Partecipazione molto buona, quindi, considerando anche che il corso era piuttosto impegnativo, 24 ore di aula su 3 giorni. 
![](/blogimages/Iscrizioni.png)
![](/blogimages/Organizzazione-di-provenienza.png)

Il tema era certamente di interesse. Parlare di trasformazione digitale nella cooperazione internazionale è ormai una necessità dalla quale è sempre più difficile prescindere. E questo non soltanto perché i donatori istituzionali cercano sempre più spesso di orientare i propri contributi ad azioni che siano caratterizzate dall’essere innovative, ma perché ormai emerge in modo chiaro come in un mondo che cambia rapidamente i propri meccanismi di funzionamento e i propri equilibri, anche le ONG devono adeguarsi e rinnovarsi. 
Durante il corso è emerso chiaramente come il tema dell’innovazione non possa essere ridotto all’apprendimento di questo o quel software e, meno ancora, possa essere delegato all’ennesimo consulente esterno. Si tratta di un processo che non riguarda il singolo progetto ma coinvolge tutta l’organizzazione e può compiersi soltanto tramite una profonda messa in discussione del proprio funzionamento. Per questo il corso ha proposto due temi non immediatamente vicini come le tecnologie dell’informazione e della comunicazione (TIC) e la Theory of Change (TOC). 

![](/blogimages/fptt-1.jpg)

Alla fine del corso sono stati somministrati dei questionari di valutazione. Le domande principali erano finalizzate a valutare l’efficacia dell’intervento formativo, sia per quanto riguarda i contenuti proposti, che le modalità di erogazione del corso. Nella seguente tabella riportiamo i valori medi delle domande principali:

![](/blogimages/domande.png)

Per avere un’idea anche della distribuzione delle risposte, si riportano i dati relativi alle prime 2 domande, su quanto siano stati raggiunti gli obiettivi del corso e del complessivo livello di soddisfazione.

![](/blogimages/Rispetto-alle-tue-aspettative-ti-ritieni_.png)

E’ chiaro che un corso con questa ambizione non potesse essere un corso tradizionale, dove un docente insegna una materia ad una classe. I tre giorni sono stati invece un continuo scambio di esperienze tra tocenti/facilitatori e partecipanti, scambio che ha permesso al corso stesso di evolvere durante le tre sessioni, per arrivare ad una proposta formativa avanzata nelle modalità e nei contenuti. 
Ringraziamo quindi tutti quelli che hanno partecipato e che hanno contribuito alla crescita di un pensiero nuovo sul tema dell’innovazione nella cooperazione internazionale.`,
